For those who love a warm, spicy, cup of chai on a cold day, this Indian
hot chocolate recipe can deliver the same comfort, in a more
Christmas-spirited way! Enjoy!

*Instructions:*

1.  On medium heat, whisk water, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, and star
    anise together in a small saucepan, until the mixture comes to a
    boil.
2.  After reducing heat to a simmer, add brown sugar and milk. Stir
    until it is fully dissolved.

    preferred temperature, but do NOT let it boil.

*Recipe \#2 - Mexican Hot Chocolate:*

It is believed by historians that Mayans, one of the best-known
classical civilizations of Mesoamerica (they rose to prominence around
A.D. 250 in present-day southern Mexico, Guatemala, northern Belize and
western Honduras), drank a similar version of hot chocolate to ours as
early as 500 B.C. Their hot chocolate included ground-up cocoa seeds,
water, cornmeal, and chili peppers. Here is a modernized iteration of
the original recipe:

*Ingredients (Makes two cups):*

-   2 cups whole milk
-   5 ounces Mexican or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
-   1 tbsp sugar
-   1 tsp vanilla extract
-   1 tsp cinnamon
-   ¼ tsp cayenne
-   Whipped cream (optional)

*Instructions:*

1.  Whisk all ingredients together in a small saucepan over medium heat
    until it comes to a simmer.
2.  Stir often and let the mixture simmer for 2-3 minutes.
3.  To create a foamy top layer, pour approximately ¾ of the mixture
    into cups, and whisk the the rest of the mixture left in the
    saucepan vigorously.
4.  After the hot chocolate in the saucepan becomes foamy, pour into two
    mugs to share with a loved one, and serve immediately!

*Recipe \#3 - French Hot Chocolate:*

A hot chocolate from one of the most romantic countries is perfect for
hot chocolate lovers who want an elevated version of the classic hot
chocolate to enjoy with a warm croissant!

    until it starts to bubble in a small saucepan.
2.  Stir in the chocolate slowly after removing the pan from the heat.
3.  Once the chocolate has melted and/or warmed up a little, put the pan
    back on the heat and stir until the chocolate is completely melted.
4.  Pour this delicious hot chocolate into mugs and serve with whipped
    cream!
