At the Beacon, we strongly believe in the importance of the student body's voice. 
While we are a student-run publication, we also believe that opportunities for 
non-contributors to share their opinions are vital in upholding the journalistic 
principles we work by. All readers of the Beacon are welcome to share their thoughts. 

To submit your letter(s), fill out 
[*this form*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQagiEv_hwucJUjdt7nWGt1hwFD3FeouPPrjdwsLJmKXkDww/viewform).
