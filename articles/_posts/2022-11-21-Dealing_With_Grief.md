title: "Dealing With Grief"
---

Depending on the day, what you are doing, and who you are with, you may
be able to avoid grief. However, grief can sometimes be overwhelming;
when one is grieving, one is suffering emotionally. We have to
understand that it is not something to be ashamed of. Grief is a natural
response to loss. Dealing with it does not have a set timeline, and the
pain caused by it ebbs and flows through you. It will vary in intensity
and appear to be gone at some points, but you can be hit with another
wave of grief even years after your loss.

Grief is usually caused by the loss of someone. It is hard to recognize
why we react the way we do. Some react in the more common way with tears
and overall sadness. Other times, grief can manifest in more
unpredictable ways such as through impatience, shame, and even
physically, in the form of illness. Some even give the impression of
being indifferent or disconnected regardless of whether or not they’re
actually in pain.

When dealing with long-term grief, you can find a way to appreciate what
came out of your loss. If you never had this person, you would have
never experienced their positive impact. Healthy coping also includes
asking for help. Often, those around you who aren’t experiencing your
loss won’t realize you are grieving. Emotional distress isn't always
obvious; it is not like having a broken arm. It’s important to ask for
help when you need it. Others may have or had similar experiences that
can help you through your grief, so you are not alone. Reaching out now
will make it easier in the future.
