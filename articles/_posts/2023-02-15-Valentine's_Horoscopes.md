**Aries:** You will get closer to a certain Libra in the near future.
They will say “slay” a lot, so you better get used to it.

**Taurus:** Avoid men with red capes.

**Gemini:** You hate those long snack lines at lunch. Why don’t you get
your other personality to wait in line for you?!

**Cancer:** Stop being so crabby. You’ve nothing to complain about, your
birthday is in the summer. How many birthdays do you spend knee-deep in
the snow?

**Leo:** You’re bound for greatness, but only if you’ve been held aloft
as a baby by a mandrill.

**Virgo:** Buy a cat and name it Chris.

**Libra:** Avoid people with L names. Mercury is in retrograde.

**Scorpio:** Your next shower will be interrupted by a large and mildly
poisonous insect.

**Sagittarius:** You will be hit by Cupid’s arrow! But you will feel a
little horse afterwards…

**Capricorn:** Tell that person you love them this Valentine’s day! You
know who we’re talking about. No! Not them! Oh my god, no. You can do
better than that. The *Other* one.

**Aquarius:** Happy birthday! Let go of something toxic. No, seriously,
put that down, it's not safe.

**Pisces:** There’s something fishy going on in your love life. You
might have to go out and hook somebody else.
