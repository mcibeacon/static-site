As students approach the end of another year at MCI, they also head
towards the end of this year's athletic accomplishments and
extracurriculars. With so many clubs and teams at our school, it can be
hard to figure out what’s going on. Before talk of next year's plans
begin, here is a recap on all things athletic from our 2021/22 school
year at MCI, as well as important information about sports in general at
our school.

Sports and athletics have always been an important part of student life
at Martingrove. According to Mr. Vujacic, who coaches several MCI
athletic teams, sports not only provide the benefit of staying fit, but
also help in meeting other students from different grades. There is also
the fact that students get to come to school and look forward to
participating in something they love, in a safe and friendly
environment. Not only do these sports influence the individuals
partaking in them, but they also raise the spirit of the people around
them. If you happened to attend any game this year, you know how excited
a crowd of MCI students can get. *“The heartbeat of a school is often
the athletics, because the most students can get involved in that
segment of extracurriculars,”* Mr. Vujacic stated in an interview.
Athletics help to positively impact the atmosphere of the school and
improve the general vibe.

This was the first year MCI has had sports in a long time, and according
to Mr. Vujacic, it wasn’t easy. After two years of Covid, and added
stress on all of the teachers, there have been less coaches than ever.
The most important thing for extracurriculars is to have teacher coaches
and as many teams as possible, in order to run as many intramurals as
possible. This gives the most number of students the opportunity to
participate. *“Nothing is more rewarding for a teacher than to have a
wonderful group of students doing something that they love,”* Mr.
Vujacic said on the subject. The coach also stated that sports wouldn’t
have even been possible this year without student coaches’ help. Nicole
Smythson-Shinozaki and Devanshi Patel coached both boys volleyball
teams, and Emma Evans, Matthew Graydon and Anne Ruprecht coached the
girls volleyball teams. Former soccer star, Dimirti Konomis, coached the
jr. boys soccer team.

Perhaps you didn’t partake in any sports at MCI this year, but would
like to potentially try out next year. Maybe you just want to join some
extracurriculars for fun or make new friends. Either way, Mr. Vujacic’s
advice is to get involved in as many sports as possible. This will
provide you more opportunities to play on various teams, including some
you may not think you would enjoy. Joining the revamped intramural
program next year is a great start to getting involved at MCI and making
the high school experience more tolerable. *“Hard work is usually more
important than skill when it comes to being a great athlete.”* Remember
this important quote, from Mr. Vujacic, for next year's sports season
and for the future ones to come.

In this year's shortened season, there are fewer sports than ever.
Luckily, the school was fortunate enough to continue with volleyball,
basketball, soccer, track and field, ice hockey, ultimate frisbee,
badminton, softball and, of course, baseball. MCI achieved great success
in these sports throughout the year, including athletes’ individual
accomplishments and entire team’s accolades. MCI coaches are happy to
recognize some standout achievements from this year’s student athletes.

-   The Senior Boys’ Soccer team was the most talented team Mr. Vujacic
    has coached for twenty-three years. Congratulations to the West
    Finalist and to our two grade twelve superstars: Adam Brattagello
    and Genti Gashi.
-   Anne Rupert led the Senior Girls’ Volleyball team to the Tier Two
    West Region finals.
-   The Varsity Boys' Ice Hockey team played in the Tier 1 division and
    the goalie, Evan Cherry, should be recognized for giving them a
    chance to compete with the other hockey powerhouses.
-   The Junior Girls' Volleyball team, led by Amada Jayaweera, had a
    fantastic season in the Tier 1 Division.
-   The Badminton team had a very strong season this year. Georgia Wu
    finished with a Silver medal at Regionals. At the City
    Championships, William Zhou successfully obtained a Bronze medal.
    Mili Sharma and Jamie Cho had a great season in the Girls' Doubles
    Division. They won gold at Regionals and Bronze at City
    Championships, qualifying for OFSAA.
-   Adyn Schell must be recognized for his baseball skills and abilities
    as a grade nine student facing grade twelves.
-   The Junior Boys' Volleyball team lost a playoff heartbreaker but
    should be commended on their undefeated regular season.
-   Wyatt Clark led the Senior Boys' Volleyball team to a respectable
    season in the Tier 1 Division.
-   The Boys' Junior Soccer soundly defeated Kipling and Lakeshore but
    couldn't get the necessary wins to advance in their tough division.

Anyone that participated in sports this year at MCI deserves to be
appreciated and acknowledged. Martingrove competed in the top tier for
most of its teams and played alongside some of the best teams in the
TDSB. Overall, every athlete played an amazing game that helped their
team and school advance and conquer. All of their hard work brought us
to the end of another successful athletics season at MCI.
