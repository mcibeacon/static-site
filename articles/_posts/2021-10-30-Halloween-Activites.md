---

Things are finally starting to get back to normal in 2021, so here are
some Halloween activities you can do with friends and family that will
put you in the Halloween spirit!

**1. Carve Pumpkins**

 Carving pumpkins is a classic Halloween activity that’s always
 exciting, fun and has a tendency to make a mess. It lets you get
 creative with your pumpkin designs, and the experience definitely
 won’t disappoint if you decide to participate in the festivities this
 year.

**2. Going to Haunted Houses**

 If you really want to get into the spooky spirit this year, going to a
 haunted house is one of the best ways to do it. Even making your own
 haunted house is a great idea! Remember to make it dark, eerie and
 full of creepy ghosts and ghouls!

**3. Decorating for Halloween**

 You won’t ever have more fun decorating for any other holiday, even
 Christmas, than you will for Halloween. You can add caution tape,
 graves, mysterious lights, cobwebs - and the list never ends. After
 all, the more elaborate your house is decorated, the more
 trick-or-treaters you're likely to draw!

**4. Making your own Halloween costume**

 Halloween really allows you to express yourself through your costumes.
 You can be anyone or anything you want to be, and making your costume
 yourself just makes it that much more personal. You can find different
 pieces of clothing from a variety of stores and put them together, or
 you can try making everything by yourself. There is no limit to your
 creativity!

**5. Telling Scary Stories**

  The ‘treat’ in the saying trick-or-treat is always enjoyable, but the
  ‘trick’ can be equally amusing as well. There is nothing better than
  scaring your friends on Halloween, and you can take it one step
  further by creating a story to make the scare more believable. Use
  props, plan your stories ahead of time and make sure you bring a
  camera, because the look on your friends’ faces when they scream will
  be a moment you won’t want to forget!


Make the most out of your Halloween this year by trying out at least
one of these great Halloween activities! Have a Happy Halloween MCI!
