title: "What Makes a Cult Classic?"
---


My definition of a “cult classic” is a movie that makes you say “this
dumpster fire of a trash movie is a blight upon my existence. I hate 
it with the burning passion of a thousand suns. Coincidentally this 
is the 7th time I have watched it this week”. These are the perfect 
movies for watching with friends, with required viewing including the 
ever popular “Rocky Horror Picture Show” and “The Room”. If you’re 
graced with chance to watch the “Rocky Picture Show” in theatres, the 
first thing you will notice is the flood of people dressed up as 
characters from the film, who are passionate about throwing rice 
during the wedding scene. 

Recent movies like the Netflix film, “Do Revenge”, received the
contradictory title of “instant cult classic” from critics. The 
misuse of this term brings me nothing more than mental agony, as the 
point of what truly makes a “cult classic” is entirely missed. The 
term has traditionally been used to describe a movie that campy or 
odd. What's important to remember about cult classics is the 
connection they find with outsiders, like the passionate rice-
throwing fans of the “Rocky Horror Picture Show”.

Streaming services heavily contribute to the recent acceleration of
movies being declared “cult classics” before the end of their box 
office weekend. Streaming makes it easier to have access to films for 
those with genuine interest, which in turn also makes it easier for 
these movies to become mainstream.

So, is it the end of cult classics? As I pondered this question, an
unexpected challenger appeared: “Minions: The Rise of Gru”. The 
“Gentle Minions” trend, where groups of people dressed up in their 
least wrinkled suits to attend screenings of the film, eerily 
paralleled those who dressed up to attend the “Rocky Horror Picture 
Show”. However, the media hype around this trend reeked of corporate 
interference and not a grassroots movement created out of genuine 
interest.

The unique thing about cult classics is regardless of however low-
budget or peculiar they are, it’s evident there is passion behind 
them, giving those films a sort of charm that no “instantcult classic” 
could ever replicate. So, if you want to watch a movie, take my advice 
and try a cult classic. By the end you will be saying “Let's do the 
time warp again”.
