title: "Meet Me at Midnight"
---

*Midnights* makes its mark as Taylor Swift’s tenth album, and the first
new music since she began rerecording her previous works in 2021. This
is huge news for Swifties, since there hasn’t been anything new since
the releases of *Folklore* and *Evermore* in 2020. Swift describes this
album as being autobiographical, showcasing her deepest insecurities,
all the while bringing back the lively air of her chart-topping love
songs of the 2010s.

*Midnights* is coined as “a collection of music written in the middle of
the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams,” which consists
of thirteen tracks. Track by track, anticipation built, and on October
7th the tracklist was completed:

1.  Lavender Haze
2.  Maroon
3.  Anti-Hero
4.  Snow on the beach (ft. Lana Del Rey)
5.  You’re on Your Own Kid
6.  Midnight Rain
7.  Question…?
8.  Vigilante Sh\*t
9.  Bejeweled
10. Labyrinth
11. Karma
12. Sweet Nothing
13. Mastermind

Fans around the world eagerly awaited for midnight on October 21st,
wanting to be the first to indulge in Swift's creative talents. After
that very first listen, people went online to post opinions, song
rankings, their favorite lyrics, and then likely retired to bed. The
truly dedicated Swifties who stayed up until 3 am, were met with a very
chaotic surprise, as promised by Swift herself. Seven new songs were
released three hours after the original thirteen.

1.  The Great War
2.  Bigger Than The Whole Sky
3.  Paris
4.  High Infidelity
5.  Glitch
6.  Would've, Could've, Should've
7.  Dear Reader

These songs, although not on the original tracklist, still follow the
theme of self-reflection and contemplation. Similar to the “From the
Vault” tracks featured in her rerecordings, these songs are extra
content which were likely too extensive to add onto the official list.
With the original tracklist taking up forty-eight minutes, the
additional songs would make the total tracklist over an hour long.

Although *Midnights* was an amazing album, there have been more than a
few online criticisms. Many thought that this album would be like her
previous two, which were very lofty, whimsical, and showed us a side to
Swift’s music we hadn’t seen before. But people were surprised to hear
the bouncy pop opening of *Lavender Haze*. Not to mention the noticeable
lack of Lana Del Rey in *Snow On The Beach*, which was a critical factor
as to why the song was heavily promoted. Fans had been anticipating a
collaboration between the two, and were severely disappointed when all
that was heard was faint whispers behind Swift’s vocals. But then again,
don’t let the negative reviews stop you from enjoying the album. Listen
for yourself, and let the haters hate.

Despite fan speculations, there will probably be a long period of time
before we hear anything new from Taylor again. With four rerecordings
still outstanding and hopes of a tour, it seems like this artist has a
lot on her plate. Until then, Swifties should appreciate the twenty new
songs and appreciate Swift's dedication to her art, her fans as well as
reflect on her incredible musical career.
