title: "Top-Three Sports Related Halloween Costumes"
---

With Halloween around the corner, I would like to present my top three
sports-related Halloween costumes.

1.  **Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) from the basketball movie *Semi-Pro.***

> This is a hilarious costume that will get some laughs no matter what.
> A bit of background information for those who aren't familiar with the
> character. Jackie Moon is the owner, coach, and player for the
> semi-professional basketball team. He made all of his money from his
> hit song, “Love Me Sexy.” He has a love for sweatbands, tube socks,
> and short shorts. So if you feel comfortable wearing this, then this
> is a costume for you!

2.  **Steve, The Pirate from the film *Dodgeball.***

> If you are familiar with the NHL, you must have seen the Trevor Zegras
> all-star shot. In this shootout, he dressed up as a member of the
> “Average Joes,” a dodgeball team of misfits that are lead by Peter La
> Fleur. There are many costume ideas from this movie, one of the best
> being Steve, The Pirate. This costume combines the best elements of a
> pirate costume, as well as a shiny gold jersey that can be worn again
> during the year.

3.  **Rudy, from the movie *Rudy.***

> This heartwarming true story about the “never say die” football player
> Rudy Ruettiger, who has a dream of playing for the Notre Dame football
> team. One of the greatest sports movies ever made, this costume might
> need a bit of explaining, but if you can pull it off, it could be one
> of the best costumes in the entire school.

I hope this column inspires you to think of a great sports related
costume. If you pull any of these costumes off, please DM the Beacon
instagram, @mcibeacon. Have a Happy Halloween!
