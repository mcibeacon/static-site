---

Being a citizen of Toronto likely isn’t a crucial part of your identity,
and if that’s the case, you may want to reconsider your priorities. The
word ‘Torontonian’ packs a larger punch than most would think, and
aligning yourself with the characteristics of a true Torontonian could
give you the quality that your personality desperately needs. By
following only four steps, you can gain an inner connection to a
metropolis known for its diversity, culture, and beautiful waterfront
skyline – plus the status of a true Torontonian.

**Step 1**.

> **Become obsessed with weekend brunch**, this is one of the easiest
> steps you’ll ever find in a ‘How-To” guide. Choose from the hundreds
> of quality brunch spots in the city and let the flavours of their
> savoury avocado toast possess you. A Torontonian craves a good Sunday
> brunch, and will wait hours for a table with friends to indulge in the
> city’s finest.

**Step 2.**

> **Always chase down those pesky TTC buses** and pray that the driver
> will stop to let you on. Developing a steel-hard grit will ensure
> you’ll get on that bus no matter the situation, as dodging lamp posts
> and cars from all angles is a Torontonian’s specialty. After all,
> making the bus *is* a key moment that determines how your day will go.

**Step 3.**

> **Become adept at walking downtown** without falling through the
> massive construction dips and potholes. Toronto may have terrible
> roads that are constantly neglected, but you can view this as an
> opportunity to develop a sixth sense unique to Torontonians. You know
> you’ve checked this box when you’re running down Front Street,
> shopping bag in one hand and lunch in the other, and somehow avoid the
> inevitable face plant onto the uneven sidewalk.

**Step 4.**

> **Lastly, persuade everyone that Toronto is better than New York**
> because of Drake, among other less interesting things. A true
> Torontonian is extremely loyal and will defend their city at all
> costs. You might complain about the TTC, or slow construction, or long
> brunch lines, but nothing should be worse to you than a snobby New
> Yorker… even if you secretly admit that they’re right.

With those steps in mind, you’ll already be off to a great start, and
will undoubtedly be a true Torontian in no time. Just remember - you’re
not becoming a stereotypical Torontonian, you’re becoming a *true*
Torontonian.
