title: "Canada qualifies for Paris Olympics 2024"
---
The hype was high in the basketball world as OKC Thunder star
Shai-Gilgeous Alexander nailed a free throw to secure Canada’s spot in
the 2024 Paris Olympics. Defeating Spain 88 - 85 in an intense duel,
Canada managed to overcome their years of misery; loss after loss, and
just when hope seemed gone, the team reached international recognition.
For those of you who aren’t into sports like I am, Team Canada clinched
an Olympics berth in basketball for the first time in 23 years! And not
only that, but Canada has only ever won one Olympic medal for
basketball: a silver at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Accolades aside,
Canada’s road to the 2024 Paris Olympics has been absolutely climactic.

Canada entered the court with their team and FOUR star players:

-   Shai-Gilgeous Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder
-   Dillon Brooks of the Houston Rockets
-   R.J. Barrett of the New York Knicks
-   Luguentz Dort of the Oklahoma City Thunder

In the first round, Canada played against France, and Canada taught them
quite a lesson with a 95 - 65 score, and a stellar performance from
Alexander: 27 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists! He made it quite close
to the elusive triple double (10 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists).

Canada proceeded to the next games with increased confidence. Sure
enough, they defeated Lebanon 128 - 73, and went on to beat Latvia 101 -
75.

Enter the second round, and we had Canada facing Brazil. Despite
Canada’s boosted confidence and intense preparations, they ultimately
fell to Brazil 65 - 69.

And then came the moment we’d all been waiting for: Canada versus Spain.
The Spanish team was the reigning champion from the last FIBA cup, yet
Canada had fostered an excellent record of 3 wins and a loss. With the
ultimate matchup of the champs vs the underdogs, the unprecedented
happened. Canada was up 86 - 85, when Alexander was fouled. Given two
shots, Alexander focused and aimed for history. If Canada won, they’d
qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Whether or not Alexander felt the
pressure, he made both those shots, resulting in Canada’s 88 - 85 lead.
With 4.5 seconds on the clock, the Spanish players zipped across the
court, and when Alex Abrines (Spain) attempted a three-pointer and
missed, it was over. Canada had officially made the Olympics. Both
stars, namely Dillon Brooks and Alexander, had stunning performances:
Alexander with 30 points, 4 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Brooks became
the 3-pointer legend with 22 points, 5 rebounds and 2 assists. Hats off
to both of Team Canada’s heroes.

Although it's quite a harsh way to say it, having just one medal in the
trophy case gives us a bigger reason to celebrate Canada’s clinch. So
let’s hit the court to watch some of the best basketball Team Canada has
to offer, and some historic performances. Paris doesn’t know what’s
coming for them!
