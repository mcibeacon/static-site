The upcoming Asian Canadian heritage month has made me think a lot about
my identity as a Chinese Canadian. More specifically, I have been
thinking about our society’s shift in attitude towards people who look
like me— from xenophobia in the past (and present), to the current
romanticization of East Asian culture.

When the pandemic first began, I encountered tireless casual bigotry.
From acts as seemingly innocuous as people deliberately not going
through doors I held open for them, to bold insolence like passersby
dramatically holding their breath as I walked past, I experienced subtle
and not-so-subtle discrimination. I was yelled at to “go home”, but
where was I supposed to go? This *is* my home.

The sad truth is that I experienced the best of it. Asian Elders faced
the bulk of the anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic— a quick
Google search for “elderly Asian Canadian hate crime” provides
17,700,000 sickening results. Social media was no stranger to the rise
in hate crimes, either. As any regular Instagram user can attest, one
would open the app to be barraged with infographics, articles, and
surveillance footage of yet another brutal attack against an elderly
Asian person.

In reality, East-Asian Canadians have faced discrimination and
xenophobia for hundreds of years. For example, the Canadian government
passed the Chinese Immigration act in 1885 as a way to restrict Chinese
immigration after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. This
act enforced a $50 head tax on Chinese immigrants, becoming the first
piece of Canadian legislation that excluded immigrants based on their
ethnicity (Gagnon et al.). The Canadian Pacific Railway itself is a
fitting example of Canadian discrimination against East Asians— the
construction of the CPR would not have been possible without the 15,000
Chinese labourers who suffered under inhumane working conditions
(Lavallé 2008), and yet the federal government did not formally
apologize until 2006 (Chan 2016).

Additionally, Asian Canadians continue to encounter a myriad of harmful
stereotypes, including but not limited to the “model minority myth” and
the “Yellow Peril” movement. Firstly, according to Yao (2021), the
“model minority myth” is a stereotype that “depicts Asians as hard
working \[*sic*\], successful at school and in the workplace, and as
economically prosperous”. While this may seem like a positive stereotype
at first, the myth “overlooks a history of systemic racism towards
Canadians of Asian descent and trivializes contemporary problems within
Asian Canadian communities” (Yao 2021). Secondly, “Yellow Peril” refers
to the social movement that was formed after Asians immigrated to
Western countries and agreed to work for lower wages, which was seen as
a threat to society (Tsu 2005). Asians were portrayed as barbaric and
uncivilized, which can be compared to COVID-related anti-Asian racism.

I am astonished by how quickly our society has shifted from alienating
East Asian Canadians to overly romanticizing our culture. Just two years
ago, East Asians were ostracized at an all-time peak, and now East Asian
culture is glorified and fetishized by our society. At times, it feels
like non-Asians love my culture more than I do. By “love”, I don’t mean
self-acceptance or anything of that nature— I mean an intense
idolization of cultural traits for which I was made fun of before.

Suddenly, my appearance, which is used to “other” me, now seems to be in
vogue. For example, the “fox eye” trend, which gained popularity in
2020, consists of people applying makeup around their eyes to make them
appear elongated and slightly upwards-slanting. This technique is most
commonly used by people with rounder eyes that are considered
“beautiful” by the Eurocentric standards that exist in North America
(and, by extension, the world). Why is this okay? My naturally
almond-shaped eyes subjected me to name-calling in the predominantly
white elementary school I attended. Now, the same people who pulled
their eyes back to mock me are wearing makeup to look more like the face
they made me resent.

It goes without saying that makeup can be a fantastic outlet for
self-expression, but when that expression comes from an oppressor
mimicking a feature for which the oppressed were shunned for hundreds of
years, it becomes more complicated.

Other examples of our society’s shift to romanticizing East Asians
include the hyperfeminine “exotic” trope used to portray East Asian
women in popular culture, and deifying East Asian media (i.e. K-pop and
anime), both of which may be classified as “Yellow Fever”. “Yellow
Fever” is a derogatory colloquial term that refers to white men
fetishizing East Asian women, or non-Asians fetishizing East Asians in
general (Spolia 2021). One cause of Yellow Fever is the harmful
stereotypes associated with East Asians— for example, being docile and
subservient. This fetishization places East Asians in a position where
society objectifies and puts us on some kind of sick pedestal, on the
basis of racial stereotypes.

I hope that this article has provided another outlook on our society’s
perception of East Asians, and the way it has shifted. Please keep in
mind that the majority of this article was anecdotal, and may not
reflect the views of others.
