<meta name="description" content="MCI’s Relay for Life team made significant progress on Thursday, October 20th this year with the “Messages of Hope” breast cancer awareness poster-signing in Martingrove’s foyer. October is breast cancer awareness month, and our Relay for Life club took the initiative to create an event at lunch where students could sign a large poster and write positive messages. There were two posters, which will be hung up at the front and back entrances of the school, for everyone to see. During this event, gold ribbons with pins were given out to each student who wrote something on one of these posters so they could represent the Relay for Life club. MCI’s Relay for Life team had pink markers and chalk for students to use to sign the posters, since pink is the colour that represents breast cancer awareness. Anyone who walked by the table was encouraged to write a message, and the posters looked amazing by the end of lunch. The students and staff members talked about how this event brought the community together, and students with relatives affected by cancer spoke about how this event was uplifting for them. Mrudul Anagal, a relay for life member, said, “This event really brings people together for a cause that affects so many around the world, and being a part of Relay for Life is great because it lets you see the school come together.” Max Hutton, a student who attended the poster-signing, said, “I find this event really important for those affected by cancer. I have a family member struggling with leukemia and I’m sure they would be thrilled to see this event happening.” Relay for Life will also have its main event in May, so everyone should look forward to raising money for cancer awareness soon." />

They were accompanied by several teachers, staff,and Grade 11 and 12 students returning as Activity Leaders, Counselors,and BLT’s (Bears Leadership Team). Campers left school early in themorning on October 2nd, and (begrudgingly) departed from camp aftereating lunch on October 5th. Campers were engaged in numerous activities each day, such as OutdoorSurvival (including shelter building and archery), Camp Rock, FieldGames, Dance, Group Rec (including sports, yoga, and mindfulness), Rocks&amp; Ropes, Hiking &amp; Geocaching, Drama, Co-op, and Arts and Crafts. In the evenings, students of all color groups would partake inactivities, including Camp-Wide Games (a series of minigames in whichcolor groups would compete for the most points), Color Chaos (acollection of games played by all campers in the camp’s hangar), and onthe last day, a Talent Show and a Dance. This year, two new color groups joined the roster of the traditionalcolors of the rainbow: pink and silver. The winner of the Rocks &amp; RopesParticipation trophy, a trophy recognizing the team that was mostengaged and immersed during the activity, was Team Pink. However, TeamOrange won both the Archery contest and Camp-Wide Games. We collectively would like to thank Mr. Hartill for supporting us andthe organization of this camp. After 15 years of dedication, care, andhard work for Leadership Camp, Mr. Hartill will be leaving the programfor his retirement - he will be missed! Without his contributions andefforts, Leadership Camp would not have been the magical experience itis and has been for so many Martingrove students. Attendees of Leadership Camp can look forward to the reunion breakfasttaking place during the late start on Wednesday, November 29th. A listof resources/contacts that students are able to access if they are inneed of help (or just someone to talk to) is available on the LeadershipCamp Instagram page, found with the user “@mcileadership”. Remember weare all here to support each other! "

    "title": "How old is too old for halloween?",
    "body": "2023/10/24 - Every year, millions of young Canadians celebrate Halloween by dressingup, going around the neighbourhood, and collecting candy that will stayin their cupboards for the weeks to come. Although Halloween is a staplein nearly every person’s childhood, there comes a point when they haveto ditch the festivities and stop trick-or-treating for good. Sadly,after this Halloween, some of us may be approaching that point, so wemust ask ourselves that looming question: How old is too old totrick-or-treat? The greatest reason for trick-or-treating is how fun it is. When we’reyoung, we’re excited by the candy and being able to dress up as ourfavourite characters. As we get older, maybe we’ve simply alreadyexperienced everything Halloween can offer us. The mystique is lost andwe end up looking for new activities to spice up the season. On theother hand, some people believe trick-or-treating is exclusively forlittle kids, and pressure older children to stop. There’s also many kidswho just get tired of going out, and would rather stay home and watchhorror movies. There’s a wide array of reasons why people stopparticipating in Halloween, but none of them answer the question athand: What is the age when it all ends? Although a lot about this topic is up for debate, it’s an unwritten rulethat Halloween isn’t for adults. Most people believe the unofficialcutoff should be around 14 or 15 years old, when people have alreadybecome accustomed to the high schooler lifestyle and can comfortablycall themselves adolescents. At that age, they are no longer consideredchildren and have to adapt to more responsibilities, which can implyditching activities deemed ‘for kids’. Others say the official cutoffshould be when people become ‘official adults’ at 18. If you’re stillconsidered a kid by the government, then why not consider yourself youngenough to participate in Halloween? Although this is all technicallytrue, another stark reality is that most adults don’t appreciate givingout candy to the older kids on Halloween. Most parents and adultsencourage the 14-15 cutoff, which is why it’s widely recognized as theprime time to stop and begin looking for other ways to spend the night. Even though there’s no definitive age when people should droptrick-or-treating, we can all agree that by the time we start highschool, we should start looking at other ways to spend Halloween. There’s so much that the holiday offers, and so many different ways tospend it: watch a scary movie, go to a seriously haunted castle, deviseinnovative ways to scare your younger siblings (my personal favourite!),etc. Of course, if going trick-or-treating with friends or family stillsounds like the best option, go for it!

    "body": "2023/10/24 - To many people, geese are probably the “Karens” of the animal kingdom—constantly inducing fear wherever they go, and honking nonstop. Love ‘emor hate ‘em, they aren’t going anywhere. So, as payback for all the poopwe’ve had to wipe from the bottoms of our shoes, we might as well gossipabout them behind their backs. Over the past couple of days, I’ve interviewed many people about theirinteractions and feelings about geese, and these people have had theirfair share of trauma. Fiona, a Grade 9, says that a goose bit her, andcountless other people I interviewed shared stories about being chasedby geese. One of these people was Nyela, another Grade 9, who says thata goose attacked her while she was walking peacefully (yikes). But have no fear, because for those of you who love geese, there is asmall but still-existing hope for their public image. While it’s not agold star of approval, the feelings these people have for them is nothate. Some people have come forward saying that they feel apathetictowards geese, and on rare occasions, the student body has even seen thegeese being friendly with a mysterious student from our school, dubbedthe “goose whisperer”. To see for myself if the overwhelming hate for geese at our school wasunfounded or not, I went to the front of the school, one of the placeswhere a lot of the geese spend their time, and attempted to interview awhole gaggle of them. My attempt was unsuccessful, though, because, forsome reason, no matter how close I stalked behind them and made noise, Iwas practically invisible to them. So for now, I guess I must go on, notknowing why they insist on harassing our wonderful MCI students! Overall, no matter the opinion you may have of geese, whether it’s theurge to burn them to the ground or the longing to play house with them,they’re not showing any sign of leaving anytime soon, so we might aswell accept it. I wish you many years of not coming into contact with goose poop! Honkyou later!! "

    "body": "2023/10/23 - It’s a known fact that people fear the supernatural. But is itreasonable to be afraid of something that’s completely natural? Take skeletons, for instance. Skeletons are pervasive in horror genrestoday, and it seems that a skeleton can be found decorating every otherhouse on the night of Halloween. Bones have become one of the de factoelements of horror. But why is that? We should be familiar with bones—we have them in our body. Why doessomething that we have with us all our lives send shivers down ourspine? Is it connected to some deep primordial fear we all carry withus, namely that of death itself? To some, death represents the end of all things—an entrance into theabyss. To others, death represents some form of transcendence, beyondthe mortal coil. Regardless of what you think of it, death is perfectlyencapsulated in the appearance of bones. Stripped of all flesh andmuscle and reduced to a pale white color, the osseous fragments thatmake up our body represent the finality and totality of death. Lifelesssockets and a thin, connected framework create a ghastly image of ahuman being reduced to its simplest parts. Perhaps that is why we fear them - because they represent a return tono-form, a world of no sensations. Do we inherently fear the feeling ofnothing, or the removal of everything we know? Perhaps the skeleton,with its empty spaces, opens a door to the abyss, through which we stareinto its endless depth. Or maybe it has to do with our survivalinstincts: seeing a skeleton out in the wild might mean that somethingdangerous is nearby, such as a wild animal or a poisonous plant. Afterall, survival trumps all other needs, especially in the ancient world. It seems as though skeletons and bones have laid root in the publicconsciousness as harbingers of doom. The quintessential ‘livingskeleton’ always appears in movies and books, showcasing the terror ofthe dead coming back to life. Indeed, figures such as the Grim Reaperand horseman of Death are often depicted as skeletons, furtherheightening the gripping terror of one’s own demise. However, skeletons have not always found their roots in that familiarfear. For example, when people in Mexico celebrate the Day of the Dead,skeletons often represent life instead of death. Life, it seems, can berepresented by a skeleton as well. In fact, skeletons certainly have the ability to represent a great dealof things beyond death. Skeletons hold us up; they support our verybody. They are the framework for our flesh and organs. Without ourbones, we would be fleshy lumps of goo, crawling around on the ground. Even the appearance of bones is deceiving; they seemingly break ever soeasily, but then turn around and repair themselves. Skeletons certainly are spooky, and the greatest reason for this creepycorrelation is ultimately death. They can represent the impending doomthat looms over us all. However, skeletons can be viewed in manydifferent ways: to one person, a skeleton might represent death, but toanother, it might represent life. Either way, they make greatdecorations. "

    "title": "Doja Cat's Scarlet: All Talk?",
    "body": "2023/10/23 - After independently making music on Soundcloud in her teens, Doja Catwas catapulted into superstardom upon the release of 2020’s Say So: abubbly pop-rap anthem of early COVID years, soon followed by theanticipated 2021 album, Planet Her, featuring Woman, Need ToKnow, and Kiss Me More. The world was ready for more of Doja’s music,but her recent adoption of a demonic aesthetic, denouncement of previousworks, and harsh words towards ‘stans’ left a mixed public perception. Alongside her controversies, a string of singles preceded her newestalbum, Scarlet, which was released this September. Doja started strong with her lead single, and my personal albumhighlight, Attention. I’d sum the song up with the concluding linefrom the first verse: “You follow me, but you don’t really care aboutthe music. ” She is clearly criticising fans that believe they have a sayin her choices, deeming them as fake fans who don’t truly appreciate hermusic. I felt optimistic about this new direction she was taking. Attentiondoesn’t fit into the homogenous Planet Her, but unfortunately PaintThe Town Red scurried back to the safety of her old style. Paint TheTown Red is a collection of uninspired earworm hooks, and a vaguebacklash against the notion of public martyrdom, yet it wasn’t as strongas her previous successes. The subsequent single, Demons, is yet againabout her public perception, while also lightly pushing her demonicaesthetic, albeit more enjoyable than Paint The Town Red. On September 22nd, we finally got to hear the entirety of what Scarlethad to offer. Doja pushed back against fans who detracted her aesthetic,retorting with “The only thing I sold was a record” in Skull andBones. Doja also exercises some of her comical lyricism in songs likeCan’t Wait, with weird quips like “I wanna be the stubborn crust ofbarnacles around you” and, my personal favourite, “If you were to becomea Middle American farmer / I’d read up on every vegetable and harvestthem around you. ” There is even a rare moment of her vulnerability whenshe raps, “I hope that I can ease some the stress, can I chime in? / Iknow I’ve been the root of the cause. ” In some regards, Scarlet didnot disappoint, with its entertaining moments sprinkled throughout. Unfortunately, that’s all they are: sprinkled. I had to scour for thebars I quoted. My interest runs dry when I listen to tracks like Gun,where we get yet another song about a reproductive appendage without anymemorable or clever lines. The album became repetitive by restating thesame concepts about the same topics, which usually range between twothings: her fans and her fame. Her instrumental and lyrical growthremain very limited, despite some slight stylistic and aestheticdeparture. The structure still remains the same: she releases a fewsingles, some of which blow up, and the rest are filler. If her goal wasto lose her ‘fake fans’, then Scarlet’s current dominance of #9 onthe Billboard 200 must mean very few were ‘fake’, but despite her PRshenanigans, she’ll eventually lose the public’s Attention.

    "body": "2023/10/23 - Nowadays, it seems like every school club, sports team, and everythingin between has an Instagram account. This has been going on for the pastcouple years, but what caused this spike? In previous years, I didn’thave Instagram and didn’t plan on getting it. However, when I enteredGrade 9, after my parents attended an information session, theyrecommended that I should get it to keep up with the school community. Ididn’t see the reason behind this, but I downloaded the app anyway. Inoticed immediately how many accounts I would have to follow: MCI SAC,MCI BAC, Relay for Life, the MCI Beacon, and many more. It’s not onlyMCI that has these accounts— other schools have them too. But the mostfascinating development has been the sports teams’ Instagram accounts. Now, it seems like every team has an account. Some are good, some arebad. But the all-time greatest sports Instagram account is the old MCIhockey account. Run by the managers, ***INSERT NAMES*** , the pageconducted interviews and facilitated creative posts all season long, asthe entire school witnessed the greatest season in recent MCI history,from the comfort of their phones. Not all accounts are good, though. If you are old like me, you rememberthe time an Instagram account that promoted hate and bullying wasinvestigated by the police. I still remember exactly where I was whenthis was announced, as many senior MCI students do. Now, there areaccounts that post memes, but use a different model, as they promotekindness and only post respectful memes. "

    "body": "2023/10/23 - MCI has a problem. Students are being attacked at lunchtime by abiological monstrosity that leaves no food untouched and no childunstung. This despicable creature has students running for their lives,following them all the way from Tim Hortons to MCI. Have you ever beenthe victim of a wasp attack? Wasps have been known from ancienttimes to be the bane of students all over the world. Unfortunately, itseems that wasps have taken a particular liking to MCI, as you can’teven step outside of the school without being chased by a wasp. Wasps have also taken over the Tim Hortons next to MCI, as HaseibNasrat, a grade 11 student at Martingrove, learned the hard way. OneFriday afternoon, Haseib was peacefully waiting to order some Timmies,when a wasp sitting on the windowsill decided Haseib was its enemy. Thewasp flew over and stung Haseib twice, on his shoulder and leg, whichcaused him moderate pain. Naturally, Haseib did not enjoy thisexperience, and when asked for his opinion on wasps, he stated, “Waspssuck,” which is an opinion many MCI students, including myself,wholeheartedly agree with. Although wasps are usually the ones stinging students at MCI, theirfriendlier counterparts, bees, often take the blame. As similar as theyseem, wasps should not be mixed up with bees. The biggest differencebetween the two is their stings. Honey bees can only sting once, astheir barbed stinger gets stuck and torn off after they sting something,which is typically fatal for them, so they only sting in self-defence. Wasps, on the other hand, are often more aggressive than bees, as theywill attack anyone near their nest, and they can sting multiple times,which is how Haseib knew he was stung by a wasp. Another big differencebetween bees and wasps is what they eat. The diet of bees consistssimply of pollen and nectar, but wasps are bloodthirsty predators,feasting on insects, larvae, and sometimes even MCI students! As you can see, wasps and bees are pretty different, so the next timeyou get chased by a flying demon, remember that it’s probably a wasp,not a bee. Bee safe Martingrove! "

    "body": "2023/10/23 - Two weeks before the beloved holiday where people wear elaboratecostumes to scavenge every home in the neighborhood in search of thebest candy possible, I interviewed some of the particularly festiveteachers at MCI. To be specific, I interviewed the following teachers ontheir favorite candy and their most memorable Halloween experiences fromwhen they were younger. Ms. Thomson (has taught at MCI for 20 years to date) Location: History Room (which she also was in as a student at MCI) Nadine: My first question for you is, what is your preferredHalloween candy? Ms. Thomson: Reese’s peanut butter cups. Hands down the best. Nadine: No hesitation. Ms. Thomson: No hesitation. Nadine: An understandable choice. My other question is, what wouldyou consider your most memorable Halloween experience to be? Ms. Thomson: One time, when I was trick or treating, I was quiteyoung then, I went to somebody’s house and I knocked on the door. Then,the fellow came out, and I had my bag and was in my costume - I don’teven remember what it was, and I said, “Trick or treat!” He responded,“Give me a trick and I’ll give you a treat!” and I never heard anyonesay anything like that before. Usually, people just put the candy inyour basket and you walk away, the usual procedure you know? And itthrew me so off guard that I just froze and I just stood there and Ididn’t know what to do. Then, finally, I just walked away. I didn’t evenget any candy, it was just the weirdest experience. Nadine: Did you see his expression after? What was his reaction? Ms. Thomson: No, I can’t really remember too much aside from that. Iremember it was a man, an older man, and I think it was like a dad jokekind of thing where he was just trying to be funny, only I didn’t get itat first and it threw me so off guard. I was also really nervous so Ijust kinda froze. That’s a memorable experience for sure. Nadine: Thank you, Ms. Thomson! Mme. Ferland (has also taught at MCI for 20 years to date) Location: sa classe de française (her French class) Nadine: Good morning, Madame. What would you say your favoriteHalloween candy is? Mme. Ferland: Mini Crispy Crunch chocolate bars. That woulddefinitely be my favorite. I remember always having them in our familyas a treat we would get, so when I got free ones at Halloween, it wasalways fun. Nadine: Free stuff is just the best. What do you remember as yourmost memorable Halloween? Mme. Ferland: I think it was the first one where I didn’t have to gowith my parents. I actually got to go around the neighborhood with myfriends and that marked the beginning of me not having to go with myparents anymore, so that was probably the most fun. Especially since wewere able to go off on our own. That was probably the most memorableone. I was maybe ten at the time. Nadine: Merci! Mr O’Reilly (has taught at MCI for 8 years to date) Location: His English classroom Nadine: What is your favorite Halloween candy? Mr O’Reilly (after careful consideration): I’ve got to say, handsdown my all-time favorite are the mini Mars bars. No question. I’ll takea box of Smarties, I’ll take a Coffee Crisp, but my all-time favorite isthe mini Mars bars. The last four years running I have bought Halloweencandy in advance to give out, but the Mars bars never make it toHalloween. I eat them. I have a soft spot for them, and if I have theopportunity, I’ll eat at least four of them. Like it’s bad, it’s a badhabit I have. Nadine: And what about your most memorable Halloween? Mr O’Reilly: My most memorable Halloween? Gee-whiz, I spent threeyears as a kid in Cleveland on Halloween trying to get my vampire down. I couldn’t. I did a bad job on the vampire, but I think I got it thelast year I had it. I had it down, I even had fake blood on my cheek(motions to face) and white pancake makeup. I even got the makeupright. I have a widows peak if you noticed. ** (reference picture to widows peak, delete after)** Nadine: Yes. Mr O’Reilly: So that is sort of essential [to the vampirecostume]. So the vampire was a good one. That stuck with me for a longtime. That’s all I can say. Another thing I want to mention is myattitude about Halloween- it’s the best Holiday out of all of them. Why?Because there’s no religious affiliation attached to it, there’s nomystical meaning and it’s pretty easy to understand. Give candy to kids. "

    "body": "2023/10/23 - The hype was high in the basketball world as OKC Thunder starShai-Gilgeous Alexander nailed a free throw to secure Canada’s spot inthe 2024 Paris Olympics. Defeating Spain 88 - 85 in an intense duel,Canada managed to overcome their years of misery; loss after loss, andjust when hope seemed gone, the team reached international recognition. For those of you who aren’t into sports like I am, Team Canada clinchedan Olympics berth in basketball for the first time in 23 years! And notonly that, but Canada has only ever won one Olympic medal forbasketball: a silver at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Accolades aside,Canada’s road to the 2024 Paris Olympics has been absolutely climactic. Canada entered the court with their team and FOUR star players:  Shai-Gilgeous Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder Dillon Brooks of the Houston Rockets R. J. Barrett of the New York Knicks Luguentz Dort of the Oklahoma City ThunderIn the first round, Canada played against France, and Canada taught themquite a lesson with a 95 - 65 score, and a stellar performance fromAlexander: 27 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists! He made it quite closeto the elusive triple double (10 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists). Canada proceeded to the next games with increased confidence. Sureenough, they defeated Lebanon 128 - 73, and went on to beat Latvia 101 -75. Enter the second round, and we had Canada facing Brazil. DespiteCanada’s boosted confidence and intense preparations, they ultimatelyfell to Brazil 65 - 69. And then came the moment we’d all been waiting for: Canada versus Spain. The Spanish team was the reigning champion from the last FIBA cup, yetCanada had fostered an excellent record of 3 wins and a loss. With theultimate matchup of the champs vs the underdogs, the unprecedentedhappened. Canada was up 86 - 85, when Alexander was fouled. Given twoshots, Alexander focused and aimed for history. If Canada won, they’dqualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Whether or not Alexander felt thepressure, he made both those shots, resulting in Canada’s 88 - 85 lead. With 4. 5 seconds on the clock, the Spanish players zipped across thecourt, and when Alex Abrines (Spain) attempted a three-pointer andmissed, it was over. Canada had officially made the Olympics. Bothstars, namely Dillon Brooks and Alexander, had stunning performances:Alexander with 30 points, 4 rebounds, and 7 assists, while Brooks becamethe 3-pointer legend with 22 points, 5 rebounds and 2 assists. Hats offto both of Team Canada’s heroes. Although it’s quite a harsh way to say it, having just one medal in thetrophy case gives us a bigger reason to celebrate Canada’s clinch. Solet’s hit the court to watch some of the best basketball Team Canada hasto offer, and some historic performances. Paris doesn’t know what’scoming for them! "

    "title": "The Modern Dystopia Censoring News Across the Nation",
    "body": "2023/10/23 - In June 2023, the federal government passed Bill C-18, An Actrespecting online communications platforms that make news contentavailable to persons in Canada—otherwise known as the Online News Act. You might have noticed the response to this legislation on Instagram—over the summer, every single reputed news source was blocked on Meta’splatforms, like Instagram and Facebook, and the block remains today. Currently, if a Canadian Instagram user tries to search for anyreputable media company on the app, they are presented with a blankscreen that reads, “People in Canada can’t see this content”. TheMartingrove Beacon’s very own Instagram page was even blocked with thesame message earlier this year. Without trusted news sources availableat the tips of Canadians’ fingertips, unverified news and misinformationcan run rampant through Instagram, Facebook, and Threads. According to the Department of Justice, the purpose of Bill C-18 is to“support news businesses to secure fair compensation when their newscontent is made available by dominant digital news intermediaries andgenerates economic gain. ” In other words, this legislation aims toensure that journalists and news companies are paid fairly when theircontent is viewed and monetized on outlets that are not directly ownedby those companies, especially in a “market environment that has beendisadvantageous to news businesses. ” It’s no news that print media is on a steady decline—according toStatistics Canada, Canadian newspapers had a 23. 9% decrease in printadvertising sales from 2018 to 2020. People aren’t buying newspapersanymore, especially not our generation. What Gen Z prefers, instead, isInstagram. Before Instagram’s recent ban, news was widely available onthe app— trusted Canadian and international news organizations wouldpost their content in a quick, simple format, accessible by all, andmost importantly, free. CBC News used to post its articles in an easily digestible format onInstagram, but the power imbalance between the CBC and the $794 billiontechnology conglomerate, Meta, meant that the CBC had little controlover how much of the revenue from its Instagram content went into itspocket, and how much went into Meta’s. Bill C-18, however, aims to strengthen the “bargaining position” of newsbusinesses in proportion to “large and dominant digital newsintermediaries”, such as Instagram or X (formerly known as Twitter),essentially making sure that the journalists and other employees atthese news companies are compensated fairly, instead of being bulliedinto submission by the platforms that host them. The just thing for these social media platforms to do is to pay the newscompanies fairly, so that Canadians still have access to what’shappening in the world around them, and so that news companies cansurvive, at a time when the news industry is on a rapid decline. However, Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, had adifferent approach. Meta banned news altogether. Canadians have begun to rely on subscriptions and apps from theirfavourite news sources, now that they are gone from Instagram. However,a key demographic is missing from this solution. Young Canadians are not subscribing to these newspapers. No teenager isspending their minimum wage earnings on an online subscription to theGlobe and Mail, the Toronto Star, or The Walrus. Moreover, it isimpractical for a teenager to take the time out of a busy school dayfilled with clubs and extracurriculars to scan the front page of a newswebsite, or browse through an email newsletter. Meta’s response to BillC-18 has also included a ban on sharing links from news sources tousers’ Instagram “stories”, effectively ridding every single channel ofcommunication for young people of reputable news, in a time wheremisinformation is rampant. Without trusted news sources on Instagram,Canadian youth have been left in the dark. Under the fundamental freedoms, section 2b of the Charter of Rights andFreedoms, Canadians are entitled to “freedom of the press and othermedia of communication. ” If Canadians must follow the law, why can’tMeta?

    "title": "Atomic Blonde: My night with Barbenheimer",
    "body": "2023/10/23 - She’s everything. He’s just Death, the “destroyer of worlds”. Do theyneed any other introduction? Barbenheimer, Atomic Blonde, whatever youwant to call it, there was an undeniably explosive impact when Barbieand Oppenheimer were unleashed upon theaters this summer. As acultural moment, it spawned double features, fashion trends, andcountless memes. Even before their release dates, Barbie and Oppenheimer wereconsistently in the news, including sparking controversy over maps ofthe South China Sea, creating discussions about the gender wage gap whencasting actors, and even causing a worldwide shortage of pink paint. Onthe surface, it seems like the question to be asking is, ‘WhyBarbenheimer?’. Why these two movies now? They weren’t two sides of awar moving towards mutually assured destruction. Instead, the publicdecided that they were perfectly matched partners, dancing the nightaway. In my opinion, Barbenheimer is more than just the atomic wasteland nextto the Dreamhouse. Both movies deal with the existential themes that arecreated by the implications of a world changing invasion. Both moviesare passion projects from well-respected writer-directors with clear,recognizable styles. Both movies have an amazing set and wardrobe, andexpansive star-studded casts. Most importantly, both movies have thisliving, breathing passion behind them for filmmaking as a craft, andthis can be felt in every second of both the movies. So, the realquestion I propose we ask instead is, ‘What does Barbenheimer mean tous?’. Well, I know what Barbenheimer means to me. Hands down, it was one ofthe best movie watching experiences I’ve had this year! I usually watchmovies in one of two ways: by myself in the dark, or—if it’s a realmasterpiece like Castle Freak or Space Truckers—by myself in thedark, yelling at the screen, and laughing at my own jokes. In reality,going to the theater with my friends to see Barbenheimer this summer wasincredibly special. So on game day, I suited up in my best pink threads and marched towardsthe nearly 6-hour-long behemoth I was about to tackle. My friends and Istarted with Oppenheimer, a tactical decision made because, by allaccounts, no one wanted to leave the fun hangout with friends on a sournote (pondering the horrors of war). As soon as the movie started I washit with two realizations: one, this was going to be a brilliant movieand two, this was the most Nolan that Christopher Nolan thewriter/director has ever Nolaned. By that I mean it has gripping sounddesign, beautiful shots with natural lighting, timeline confusion,famous or upcoming actors in glorified cameos (Shout-out to Jack Quaidand his bongos) and Cillian Murphy in incredibly well-cut suits. If youput this movie in a line-up of other releases this year and said ‘pickout the Nolan movie’, it would be like putting Michael Myers in a policeline-up and saying ‘pick out the killer’. After taking a break to refuel, we were met with waves of pink floodingthe lobby of the theater. Everyone was fully dressed to the nines to seeone movie: Barbie. Getting into the theater and seeing all thefemale-presenting people waiting to watch the movie gave me a flashbackto the last time I was in a similar situation. In middle school, all thegirls in my class were taken to the gym to watch a documentary about‘female empowerment’, which was just really brutal stories about girlsbeing catty to each other. When we got back, we found out that the boyshad gotten to spend the entire period playing video games. Barbietakes this viewpoint and promptly kicks it out of the Dreamhouse. Is it the perfect movie on feminism? No. Barbie is like Bernie Sandersrunning in an election. It’s there to start a conversation. Despite theimmaculate sets, perfect costume designs, and brilliant wielding ofMattel Lore (I see you, Magic Earring Ken), the part of Barbie that Ienjoyed the most was the positive atmosphere in the theater. There wereso many different people watching and enjoying the movie. When AmericaFerrera gave a speech about how hard it is to be a woman, the entiretheater started clapping- something I’ve never ever experienced before. I’m worried that movie execs will take the wrong message fromBarbenheimer. Studios are already trying to replicate this success byreleasing the horror film Saw 10 and the children’s film Paw Patrol,and marketing them as ‘Saw Patrol’. But what they fail to understand isthat you can’t force meaning into movies - the truth is, people make themovies meaningful. "

Straus is a grade twelvestudent from North York, and though his campaign is satirical, it showsthat there are no constraints to what young people in this city canaccomplish. During the interview, Straus was accompanied by his campaignmanagers, Talia Kirshblum and Boaz Shron. They were all on their spares,and so was I. Note that this interview has been edited for length and clarity. S: This afternoon I am joined by Meir Straus, Toronto’s youngestcandidate in the 2023 mayoral by-election. Mr. Straus is a grade twelvestudent from North York, and he is most definitely a real man, and notthree raccoons in a trench coat. Thank you for joining us, here in thesecret room of the Martingrove Library, Mr. Straus. How’s it going? M: It’s going great. Thank you for confirming that I am a realperson, and not three raccoons in human clothing and wrapped up inplasticine. I am a real person, and there have been rumours, but theyare false. S: Of course. We do our best to report with the utmost journalisticintegrity. First off, I must ask: how is senioritis treating you? M: I don’t care. I want to get out of [school], and into CityHall. S: Your platform lists popping all the balloons in the city as a wayto combat inflation. What are the environmental implications of this?What about the moles of helium gas that will be released into ouratmosphere and the pieces of rubber and plastic that will litter thestreets of Toronto? M: Yes, there are environmental implications, but it’s all in theinterest of the economy. Because inflation has been rising year afteryear, Torontonians can’t keep up. So, we have to pop all the balloons inthe city that are hovering outside our windows, constantly hovering intoour living spaces. It’s the worst. We need to end inflation by poppingall the balloons. When it comes to rubber on the streets and helium inthe air, so be it. S: On a scale of 1-10, how silly and goofy are your opponents,compared to you? M: 11. I might be a clown, but at least I admit that I’m a clown. S: Your platform states, “To reduce light pollution we will turn offthe stars”; what about me? My mum tells me that I’m a star every day,and I’m sure yours does too. M: You’re just going to have to be a necessary casualty. Lightpollution in this city has become too much. People can barely see. Andif you are a shining star, as your mom tells you, you are just going tohave to be eliminated. It’s all in the best interest of the city. S: What is your favourite Drake song? M: My favourite Drake song is the one where he goes (unintelligiblenoises). S: You heard it here first, folks. Meir Straus does not know thenames of any Drake songs. S: Rate Auston Matthews’ mustache out of 10. M: I could do better. (sadly) Never mind, I can’t. I’m going to haveto rate it (an obscene two-digit number) out of ten. He’s our hero. S: Our school’s student council election campaigns are happeningright now, just as the mayoral campaigns are happening. What advice doyou have for our candidates? M: Well, I haven’t won yet, emphasis on the yet. The advice I wouldgive is to pander to grade nines and make lots of crude jokes. S: Lastly, on a more serious note, young people’s voices are oftendismissed by our society. When we try to express our thoughts andconcerns, we are often told that “we don’t know what we’re talkingabout”, or that these issues don’t affect us. However, it is clear thatthese issues do affect us: namely, you mentioned the housing andmental health crises on CP24. What other issues should the youth ofToronto be aware of, and how do we make progress, if we’re too young tovote? M: That’s a great question. When it comes to making progress on yourown, the way you can really do it is to vote, if you’re over the age of18 . Go to the polls and vote for a candidate who will actually solvethese issues. Or, vote for me. When it comes to the issues themselves,affordability is one that’s going to affect us the most, especially ifwe want to live in Toronto our whole lives. Unless things drasticallychange, affordable housing is built, rent control is enforced, and moreunits are created by the city, we won’t be able to live here. There is alot that the city can do to make sure the housing prices go down. Essentially, vote and keep an eye on the election. Keep an interest init. Read articles, listen to your local politicians speak, network withthem, and reach out for interviews for your school newspapers. Do whatyou can. Knock on doors, go to events. Straus’ platform can be found on his website, meir4mayor. ca, or on hisTwitter and Instagram, both at @meir4mayor. "

Silver ShrimpStudios is my emerging video game design studio, focusing onstorytelling, art direction, and connections to real-world problems. Read on to learn strategies I used to start the venture, insights intomy first game, “Phytopia”, and plans for its expansive future. Starting the Business For a while now, I’ve had a deep interest in 3D modeling, illustration,VFX, and other fields in the digital art world. I enjoy seeing uniqueworlds and characters come to life, especially by my cursor. I believethis drive is what unites artists across the world. At the same time,I’ve developed various programming and computer engineering skills,through school and online resources. I treated these as separate spacesuntil January of last year, when I jumped into the complex andSTEAM-centered community of indie game design and combined my interestsand skills. I quickly became engaged with game design because of theextent of flexibility and opportunities that stem from it. Throughexperimentation, I created several straightforward games based on coreconcepts. Although enlightening and unique, they were not for sale. Then, course selection for this year was upon me. I enrolled in our Entrepreneurship: The Venture Course, taught by Mr. Goldberg. One of Martingrove’s great qualities is its great variety ofopportunities, as is offered by this course. With Mr. Goldberg’sguidance, I built a marketing and management toolset as parts of mybusiness plan. For those looking for tips with a new venture, here are afew key concepts I found useful:  Unique Selling Proposition (USP)     Demonstrates to the customer that your business isdifferent. Your method may not be faster or cheaper, but theunfamiliarity will attract attention. A Silver Shrimp USP: Aconnection to real world challenges, such as climate change, ineach game.     Competitive Analysis     Obviously, this will help you gauge your environment. Moreimportantly, it helps you form statistical aspects of yourventure. Phytopia’s price will vary based on the price ofsimilar indie games, and the number of development hours.     Marketing and Financial Plan     Often overlooked aspects of a business venture. Determinewhere and how both people’s money and attention will flow andfocus.     Executive Summary     Focusing your ideas across your business, so you can pitchit to potential investors, or write articles like this one.    After semester 1, I found enacting my plans wasn’t all smooth sailing. An entirely digital business contains no billboard signs nor posters forcustomers to walk by, as a coffee shop might. Rather, space on the WorldWide Web flows in the very different way of clicks and shares, and isexpensive to direct. That’s why I’ve branched out into physical mediums,such as this article, word of mouth, and posters. I’ve also optimized myonline advertising by targeting only interested customers, and focusingon a few direct platforms, my website and Instagram, making updateseasier. Based on all these factors, I’d attribute my venture’s success so far,and the keys to starting one of your own, to an interest inexperimentation and embracing wonder, participating in a community thatprovides opportunities for growth, and the pursuit of thoseopportunities no matter what challenges or doubts you face. I’m lookingforward to creating amazing art with Silver Shrimp, and I hope you’lljoin me. This starts with Phytopia, an adventure as a time travelingexplorer. Phytopia Based on the Player Survey, you are most interested in an action andstorytelling adventure with engaging combat. Therefore, Silver Shrimp’sfirst game will be exactly that, with themes about the environment, andeven time travel. You’ll follow a misdirected and ingenious soul whobreaks free from regulation, to find the world is not as straightforwardas it appears. It’s turning out to be a detailed story with a cartoon,using a 3D art style that is best for picturing a variety of landscapes. However, an indie developed game will change drastically over thedevelopment period based on feedback and new ideas, so stay tuned fornew features and changes to Phytopia. Development logs for programming,story creation and more will likely be bi-weekly. Seeing as you’ve reached the end, go check out the Silver Shrimp websiteat https://www. silvershrimp. ca/, or the instagram account:@silver_shrimp_studios. Here I’ll post game development logs and muchmore detail on the topics I’ve covered in this article. "

    "body": "2023/04/01 - Thursday, Martius XXXI, XLIV BC  Et tu Murphy?: Is Ryan Murphy’s “Caesar” Bioplay Too Soon Why create a new story when you could tell a “true” one? Or at least onebased, albeit very loosely, on a real person’s life. The recentlyreleased play “Caesar” ponders this very question. Admittedly, Caesarhas been criticized for being “a bit too soon”, as it has only been XVIdays since this year’s Ides of March, the infamous day when Caesar wasstabbed XXIII times by members of the Roman Senate. However, it has beenreleased just in time for award season and it’s no secret that theAcademy loves bioplays. After all, one-third of nominations and awardswon by famous Roman actor Meryrlous Streepous have come from historicalplays. “Caesar” has also been under a fair amount of scrutiny for its portrayalof its title character. News outlets like The Roman Times, havecriticized the bioplay for glossing over Caesar’s controversies, such ashis reputation as a tyrant, as well as his betrayal of formertriumvirate member Pompey, which resulted in the civil war thatfollowed. The biopic also has been criticized for intentionally tryingto sweep Caesar’s extramarital affair with Cleopatra, the current leaderof Egypt, under the rug. Members of Caesar’s family have also spoken out about the release ofthis play. His wife, Calpernia, released the following statement; “Itwas against Julius’ wishes for plays to be made about him after hisdeath, he was a very private man. ” She went on to state that Caesardisliked intrusive news outlets and paparazzi, citing the Bona Deascandal where The Inquirer exposed Caesar’s ex-wife, Pompeia’s, allegedaffair with politician, Publius Clodius Pulcher. The writer and director of this play, Ryan Murphy, released a statementclaiming “we [the studio] tried to get in touch with Caesar’s family,via stone tablet, II days after his passing but for whatever odd reasonthey didn’t reply. ” Murphy also mentions the great respect he and histeam had for Caesar’s final wishes, mentioning that they “only wentthrough his private quarters III times and only took three-fourths ofhis personal belongings for research. ” How cordial of them. Murphy andhis team eventually got in contact with Caesar’s nephew, Marcus JuniusBrutus and his colleague, Gaius Cassius Longinus, both of whom becameproducers for the play. In the play, there is a compelling side plot following fictionalizedversions of Brutus and Cassius trying to stop Caesar from beingassassinated. Strangely, in one of Caesar last conversations with hisclose friend and confidant, Mark Antony, as outlined in Antony’srecently released biography “Arms Without Head”, Caesar allegedly toldAntony, “If I die, I’m almost 100% sure Cassius is involved and maybeBrutus. But like I totally don’t trust Cassius, that guy is reallysketchy. ” Separated from it’s controversies, “Caesar” is a subpar play, making nonew or creative observations about its title figure. It clings to theformulaic emotionally manipulative structure of bioplays, with Caesar’scharacteer catapulting from a nobody with the falling sickness toaccomplishing incredible feats, rising above various challenges, givingan inspirational speech and then passing away dramatically. In regardsto the staging and blocking of the play, “Caesar” makes confusingdecisions making the rhythm of some scenes seem awkward and forced. One of the few highlights of “Caesar’’ is the performance by up-andcoming actor, Austinus Butlarus, or as he is commonly known as AustinButler, who credits his impressive performance to the technique of“method acting” which helped him get into Caesar’s mindset. In a recent interview, Butlarus admitted that stepping into the shoes ofthe former Roman emperor has cost him more than he anticipated. Butlarusbelieves that taking on the role has had long term effects on him,stating that “I [Butlarus] feel like the ghost of Caesar is with me,you know? I still feel like I could come down with the falling sicknessanytime. ” Butlarus’ fear may not be entirely out of the realm ofpossibility, as he is no stranger to roles that became a bit toolife-like. The previous year, Butlarus was casted to play the role ofmythical Greek musician, Orpheus. The role irreversibly damaged hisvoice, giving him a Thracian accent, resulting in extreme emotionalturmoil for Butlarus, so much so that at every award show last year, hewas often spotted uncontrollably crying over his “lost love”. Strangelyenough, both his damaged voice and emotional turmoil ceased once lastyear’s award season was over, giving Butlarus hope that if he doesdevelop the falling sickness during awards season, it will clear itselfup one the season ends. The release of Murphy’s bioplay, “Caesar”, has become a topic ofcontroversy. Many, including myself, found Murphy’s decision to releasethe bioplay so close to Caesar’s death to be a vile, unethical ploy toprofit off of the death of a man whose last wishes were disrespected. Despite “Caesar” being of questionable quality, I fully expect that theplay will clean-up during the upcoming awards season. Critics rating: 9stabs out of 23.

    "body": "2023/04/01 - Arushi Unny - “…he used a weather machine to make it snow on the dayof the winter assembly. ” What happened to MCI’s beloved Student Administrative Council? From adelayed assembly to exasperated executive members, the SAC faced itsfair share of challenges in the 2022/23 school year. How did they manageto survive? Who got them back on their feet? How did things turn out? It almost seemed like the holiday assembly wasn’t going to happen; theodds were piling up against SAC. The concept of “Christmas in March”didn’t seem too festive, but don’t take it from me, take it from the SACpresident himself, Liren Abeyratne. After hunting the school grounds forthe SAC president, I finally saw Liren. He had a lot on his plate, andhe seemed a little unnerved — the typical state of a man in charge of alot, maybe too much. After being pestered into an interview about theholiday assembly, Liren had a statement ready to go. His statement wentas follows: “The SAC is sorry for the delayed assembly. The SAC and all other clubswere all looking forward to the assembly, but it was unfortunatelypostponed due to the snowstorm and we had zero control over that. Thedifficulty after the break was finding a timeline that was fine with allof the teachers and didn’t mess up exam season. Students stressed outover the assembly and didn’t want to lose class time, so the SAC foundjust before March Break to be the best time for the assembly, especiallyas it would match the holiday vibes. ” According to Liren’s statement, it sounded like the SAC had a lot oftrouble with the scheduling of the assembly, and March 10th ended upbeing the most appropriate date. Sometimes nature wants the opposite ofwhat we want, and that is a difficult obstacle to overcome. However, SACmanaged to leap over that hurdle with grace, evoking holiday cheer inthe student body even when the holiday season had gone. Returning to the controversial topic of the “Holiday” Assembly, ArushiUnny, an SAC executive member, when asked for details about the delays,let the Beacon in on some juicy, gossip-worthy information. Unny statedthat Abeyratne made it snow on the original date of the assembly. Clueless MCI students had no idea their beloved SAC President was also avile, assembly-sabotaging monster, delaying the event and tarnishing thename of the SAC by creating a fake snowstorm in the area. Hisaccomplice? A fake snow machine! After some more digging, another SAC executive member, Armaan Thandi,came forward to add his two cents about the “Holiday” Assembly. Thandi,when asked for an interview, fearfully gulped, and scouted out thehallway, turning his head left and right, weary of a certain someonehearing his statement. His voice shaking, he quietly whispered to me,“Liren’s plan led SAC members to believe that we might not have anassembly at all because Liren is afraid of singing. ” Many students,including me, can attest to this statement, as I, amongst many others,still have nightmares of Liren Abeyratne singing on Grade 8 InformationNight. His terrible voice fuels my desire to sue. The word got out that I was doing investigative work regarding the SAC,and I was approached by a grade 12 student named Owen Reid, who claimedhe was a SAC executive member. Learning more of my investigativejournalism regarding the SAC, Reid quickly exclaimed, “Liren is apower-hungry, egotistical, selfish president who [allegedly] laundersfunds from the SAC with the help of Muhammad Qadeer!” It seems as though something fishy is happening behind closed doors inthe SAC, with Abeyratne as the ringleader of it all. I conducted moreinterviews with Abeyratne’s co-executives to determine what they thinkof him as president of the SAC. In a separate interview with ArmaanThandi, conducted while he was giving out semi-formal tickets, he ventedhis frustration to me. “Liren asked me to help out with the ticketsales, and at the busiest time he wasn’t there, but now he comes in whenall the hard work is done, taking all the credit. ” stated Thandi, assheer frustration coated his voice. Unny was also outraged at Abeyratne, and upon hearing what Thandi had tosay, he reached out to me over social media stating, “He [Liren] isawful at managing spreadsheets. We [the SAC] work tirelessly for daysat a time to ensure the spreadsheet system is running smoothly, butLiren touches it and in 30 seconds he’s managed to confuse us all. ”Armaan and all other SAC members deserve a standing ovation for theirhard work in the SAC, but also for cleaning up after a man-child likeLiren. At the time of writing, the assembly has yet to come to fruition, yetthe undeniable tension brewing within the SAC ranks has many wonderingif the assembly will once again be postponed. The situation isunfortunate and completely unavoidable had Abeyratne not becomecorrupted by the power of being SAC President, and perhaps picked up asinging lesson or two. Yet the question that remains is, will the SACpresident step up and fulfill his presidential duties, or will he fakeyet another snowstorm?

    "body": "2023/04/01 - Being a citizen of Toronto likely isn’t a crucial part of your identity,and if that’s the case, you may want to reconsider your priorities. Theword ‘Torontonian’ packs a larger punch than most would think, andaligning yourself with the characteristics of a true Torontonian couldgive you the quality that your personality desperately needs. Byfollowing only four steps, you can gain an inner connection to ametropolis known for its diversity, culture, and beautiful waterfrontskyline – plus the status of a true Torontonian. Step 1.  Become obsessed with weekend brunch, this is one of the easieststeps you’ll ever find in a ‘How-To” guide. Choose from the hundredsof quality brunch spots in the city and let the flavours of theirsavoury avocado toast possess you. A Torontonian craves a good Sundaybrunch, and will wait hours for a table with friends to indulge in thecity’s finest. Step 2.  Always chase down those pesky TTC buses and pray that the driverwill stop to let you on. Developing a steel-hard grit will ensureyou’ll get on that bus no matter the situation, as dodging lamp postsand cars from all angles is a Torontonian’s specialty. After all,making the bus is a key moment that determines how your day will go. Step 3.  Become adept at walking downtown without falling through themassive construction dips and potholes. Toronto may have terribleroads that are constantly neglected, but you can view this as anopportunity to develop a sixth sense unique to Torontonians. You knowyou’ve checked this box when you’re running down Front Street,shopping bag in one hand and lunch in the other, and somehow avoid theinevitable face plant onto the uneven sidewalk. Step 4.  Lastly, persuade everyone that Toronto is better than New Yorkbecause of Drake, among other less interesting things. A trueTorontonian is extremely loyal and will defend their city at allcosts. You might complain about the TTC, or slow construction, or longbrunch lines, but nothing should be worse to you than a snobby NewYorker… even if you secretly admit that they’re right. With those steps in mind, you’ll already be off to a great start, andwill undoubtedly be a true Torontian in no time. Just remember - you’renot becoming a stereotypical Torontonian, you’re becoming a trueTorontonian. Image taken by Theo Boychev This article is part of “The Bacon” - The Beacon’s April Fools’ edition.

    "body": "2023/04/01 - Bears, have you ever wondered what your favorite teacher does duringEaster? Ponder not a millisecond longer as we’ve conducted top secretinterviews, compiling a curated guide of early preparations for thisyear’s festivities by your favorite faces at MCI! This article wasinspired by “CEOs Explain How They are Celebrating Black History Month”by the Onion. Mr. Reardon: Our sources tell us he took up a part-time job as an EasterBunny last year, but was unfortunately forced to resign since childrenwere horrified upon seeing his immense frame in a bunny costume. We’reunsure of his plans this year. Mr. Lee: This year he is organizing a dinner and egg hunt for hisfamily. After paying for the groceries at his local Loblaws, he becameengaged in a controversial conversation with the cashier. Our sourcesreport that Mr. Lee remains stationed at the Loblaws, unable to walkaway from the heated debate with the worker. His family, particularlyhis sister, is becoming increasingly concerned the event will neverhappen and the eggs will go to waste. Mr. Parker: After registering his children for the Easter Egg hunthosted by his local community center, he discovered the chocolate eggscontained preservatives, GMO cocoa, and were almost entirely whitesugar. He immediately sued and, at the time of writing, the court hadnot yet come to a decision. Mr. Sommerfelt: He reportedly took his daughter to Nordstrom to find anEaster outfit, when he discovered that they don’t sell button up plaidshirts and satchels for 4-year olds. He filed a complaint, furtherangered by the lack of punctuality by customer service. After readingtheir apology email, which included the incorrect use of “there” and“they’re”, Sommerfelt’s rage made him create a “customer service rubric”on which he graded the American luxury department store 40% and emailedit back to the company. On March 2nd, 2023, the company announced theywere shutting down all 13 of their stores within Canada. Mr. Farrow: He is currently preparing to host the annual ‘Teacher’sEgg-Spoon Race’, with the contestants having yet to be determined. He’shoping this year will be an improvement from last year, as he wasseverely disappointed since the eggs were violently de-shelled by theFamily Studies Department and transformed into deviled egg displays,forcing the race to be postponed. Ms. Werhun: A little known fact about her is that she’s responsible forher neighborhood’s annual Easter egg hunt, optimizing the fun bycalculating the success probability of each hiding spot. However, toreally mark the 50th anniversary of the hunt, our sources have told usthat eggs will be hidden in the most difficult places to maximizefrustration and catastrophe. Ms. Werhun intends on graphing her successafter the event. Ms. Chang: “Easter???…fun???…. celebrations???…absolutely not. Iwill be practicing, and you should be too. ” Image taken by Julia Wu This article is part of “The Bacon” - The Beacon’s April Fools’ edition. We hope you enjoyed! "

    "title": "An Assembly Of Winter Magic",
    "body": "2023/04/01 - For a so-called “winter assembly”, it barely made it to the finish line;it was held on March 13th and winter ended only seven days later. TheAssembly was originally set for December, just before the holidays, butit ended up being delayed twice. Although all performances are reviewed in this article, keep in mindthat it was a two-and-a-half hour assembly, and this column squeezes itall into eight hundred words, so if anything is missing or misspelled(including the name of performers), I apologize. After some brief remarks by the MC, Mr. Farrow, the concert began with apajama-clad SAC singing a modified version of the classic Beatles tuneLet It Be, and my ears were suddenly ringing loud when they claimedthat SAC is the best club at MCI (how is that possible, when the bestclub is obviously the Beacon, the club that provides MCI with only thebest news and opinion pieces). However, the ringing stopped when Mr. Farrow started his electric guitar solo, rivaled only by the late JimiHendrix (rest his Are You Experienced soul). The next act came from Tanesha who played piano and sang Rihanna’s hit“Stay”, and it is clear that she put a great deal of time and effortinto this emotional ballad. The next artistic effort, a dance numbercalled The Grinch was somewhat ambiguous; the MC was correct about themisleading name, considering it was two students dancing to a song thathad nothing to do with the Grinch and was instead a rap song about thedays in a month. It turned out that this ambiguous rap song was awelcome surprise. The comedian Aleksa was next. His jokes, which were all about thesilliness of math, brought unpleasant memories of math homework, butwere actually quite funny. From this writer’s perspective, many of the later performances,specifically the many dance numbers, must have required an absurd amountof practice. Ting-Wei’s dance piece, featuring a great deal of jumps andbaton-twirling to music from Kung Fu Panda, deserves special mention,given how fantastic it was and with how many bones the MC claims hebroke while watching it. Although the next act, a simple magic trick by fellow Beacon writer,Alisha, was fine, it also felt more like a commercial for the ScrabbleClub than a performance. In that case, Stupid Magic Tricks (influencedby the old Late Show with David Letterman) and High School talentshows really do go hand-in-hand. Dancing requires a great deal of practice, and the next performance wasby Ishani, who performed a beautiful traditional Indian dance in whichshe was alone and in a trance as if her spirit were overtaken, gettingready to see her lover, who has unknowingly died. Overall the experiencewas absorbing. The drama department was so impressed by her performance,they will be creating a show next year surrounding her dance. To give the audience a break from the performances, we were given atreat— advertisements crafted by the various clubs at MCI to promotetheir respective group. In summary: BAC is excellent at trick shots,Environmental Club sings beautifully, and Breakfast club, Chess club,MOD, and Computer Science are pros at video production. Lastly, ofcourse, The Beacon produced the best commercial, really demonstratingthe lengths management will go to to enslave their best and brightest;ahem, produce high-quality articles. For the contest portion of the assembly, various teachers and studentsperformed a series of contests for bragging rights. The contestsincluded planking, watermelon-eating, catching gummy bearswith theirmouthsand finally telling jokes. There was a great deal of intensestaring during the laughing portion of joke-telling, and the pieing ofthe SAC Core Four was just as funny as it was the day before. Theaudience was ready for more acts to follow. “Aidan And The Teners” was scheduled to be a septet, but they werereduced to six since the group’s namesake fractured his arm. Thisgroup’s performance was probably the most ambiguous during theAssembly—it was good but it may have been difficult to appreciate themusic given the group’s small size or the need for a larger range ofinstruments. After that, there was TBE (the best ever). First, a South Asian attire-clad SACA put on an excellent performance. Colours flowed, music rang and the whole audience was enthralled bySACA’s performance. Second, there were back-to-back singingperformances, and it should be noted that it takes nerve for somebody,anybody, to go up on stage and sing their hearts out like these twoladies. Fortunately, both of them turned out to be good. In fact,someone a few rows in front of this writer was so moved they used theirApple Watch as a second flashlight to wave around. Mr. Farrow wascorrect; Benedicta can talk and sing loudly without a microphone. The final two performances were incredibly well-chosen; any meal is onlyas good as the dessert, and both jazz presentations were fantastic. Inconclusion, everyone did a great job, and the effort required by boththe performersand those working behind the scenes was insurmountable. Congrats to all! "

    "title": "Opinion: Last Friday’s snowstorm proves that cars are not the answer",
    "body": "2023/03/08 - I am someone who needs to feel the sun on my face daily, or else I’llfeel off the whole day. So, last Saturday, like any other day, I lacedup my shoes and went for a walk. However, there was one slight problem—the biggest snowstorm of the year had occurred the night before. Only a few households in my neighbourhood had shovelled their sidewalks,and I had made the unwise decision of wearing trail runners. So, I leaptover the gutter-turned-river and started my walk on the road. As I walked alongside the massive snowbanks, I waved “hello” to many ofmy neighbours doing the same— people were running, walking their dogs,and even pushing strollers on the road because the sidewalks weren’tclear. The snowstorm caused most drivers to stay home that day, so thenumber of vehicles on the road was minimal, and even the odd car stillhad room to pass pedestrians safely. I was happily reminded of a Dutchurban planning concept called Autoluw. Autoluw directly translates to “low-traffic”, but it is betterinterpreted as “nearly car-free. ” It is a theory that prioritizespedestrians and cyclists over drivers, while still ensuring thatnecessary automobiles, like emergency vehicles or delivery trucks (orsnowploughs!), can get through. Last Saturday, my entire neighbourhoodunintentionally followed this principle, and it was miraculous. EveryoneI encountered on the road was grinning from ear to ear, and even thehomeowners condemned to laborious shovelling greeted me as I walked by. Road walking felt so much more communal than the sidewalk version,perhaps because we pedestrians were allowed onto the road itself,instead of being shoved to the sides. I felt a strange sense ofcamaraderie— we walked on the road together, however separate ourdestinations may have been. Walking on the road made me feel like myneighbourhood was meant for me, a person, and not a giant, insentient,two-ton metal box. Shouldn’t that be the case everywhere? Neighbourhoodsbuilt for people, and not for cars? Car-centric design is commonplace in most North American suburbancommunities, especially in Etobicoke. Some neighbourhoods are soinconvenient for pedestrians that one simply needs a car to getaround, fueling a myriad of issues ranging from spatially-obliviouschildren to socioeconomic inequality. Planning is politics, after all. So, what can we learn from Friday’s snowstorm? Now that we know that pedestrian commutability trumps all, we can adaptto a city where people are the main priority, instead of cars. Reliable and equitable public transit, safe infrastructure, and changesin public policy are all avenues to a less car-centric city, but let’sstart small, with pedestrian infrastructure. Let’s add sidewalks wherethere are none, and improve the ones that already exist. Let’s expandthe pedestrian head start, so the most vulnerable members of ourcommunity can cross the street safely. Let’s reclaim our neighbourhoodsfrom the cars! Think of it not as limiting automotive access, but expandingpedestrian access— or rather, human access. I started my walk grumbling to myself about my neighbours not upholdingtheir civic duty, and I ended it wide-eyed and rosy-cheeked, brimmingwith joy over the realization that maybe there is a way for SuburbanEtobicoke to relinquish its car-centric design. In an age of“fifteen-minute city”-based political hysteria, we must warm our hearts(and our legs) to the future— walkable communities for all. "

Last February, all that money was spent on cheap heart-shapedchocolates, short-lived red roses, and lovey-dovey romantic dinners. Theblasphemous “day of love” is absolutely unnecessary, with the innateidiocy of this “holiday” combined with overspending and the oppressionof the singles contributing to the atrocity known as February 14th. Think of Christmas, Eid or Lunar New Year, all of which are widelycelebrated, with rich histories intertwined tightly with religiouscustoms, giving people real reasons to indulge in a holiday. They areat least a good use of your money. Valentine’s Day, on the other hand,not so much. When you ask people their favorite holiday, I can almostguarantee they will not say Valentine’s day. It’s irrelevant and a daymany partners dread as they try to hunt down the perfect gift. Not tomention, the absolute most absurd way to celebrate love, with grand,money-filled gestures replacing warm actions of real love. Have you ever wondered how we always end up spending more than weintend? Consumer behavior is ridiculously easy to predict andmanipulate, and Valentine’s day is no exception. Stores bedazzlethemselves with red and pink, adorned with fake-flowers, complete withthe grandest assortments of candies, chocolates, stuffed animals holdinghearts and cheesy cards all seem way over-the-top, but clearly,companies know how to profit. And it works a little too well. I get it- it feels nice buying your cherished ones something they willlove. I’m sure many of you can relate; you’ve just started datingsomeone you really like and want to show your appreciation for them. Butat what cost? For that same person to “make a mistake” or “losefeelings”? How about your ex-best friend that ditched you? Were allthese people really worth shedding the money on? For those of you who don’t have that special someone, someone to love,how often do find yourself staring at a couple, thinking: “Man, I hopethey find out they’re related”, or find yourself listening to “kiss methru the phone” by Soulja Boy, hoping someone, somewhere, does indeedwant to kiss you through the phone? In essence, Valentine’s Day is an abominable “holiday” with no realpurpose besides swindling people out of their money and making everyoneelse feel lonely. Before you fall victim to this, or waste your hardearned money on that special person this Valentine’s Day, I suggest youtake a moment to reconsider a better use of your money, which is quiteliterally anything other than a stupid pink bear holding a stuffed “Ilove you” heart.

    "body": "2023/02/15 - Commemorating the vital contributions of Katherine Johnson, one of thefirst black women to work for NASA. On July 16th, 1969, at 8:32 AM, the course of American history wasforever changed as people across the globe tuned in to view thelaunching of the Apollo 11 from Cape Kennedy, with the ambitious goal oflanding three U. S astronauts on the moon. This “one small step for man,one big leap for mankind” would have never manifested if it were not forthe contributions of one brilliant woman. Born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia on August 26, 1918,Katherine Johnson, born Katherine Coleman, would accomplish a more thanimpressive resume. Johnson’s fondness of numbers and high intelligencewould catapult her to high school by age 10, later graduating with abachelor’s degree in Mathematics and French, earning highest honoursfrom West Virginia State College. In 1953, Johnson was hired by the National Advisory Commission forAeronautics, NACA, at the Langley Laboratory in Newport News, WestVirginia. She worked at the West Area Computing Unit, composed ofAfrican-American women tasked with manually performing complexmathematical calculations to provide to NACA engineers. The unit washeaded by Dorothy Vaughn, and was also where Mary Jackson, the firstAfrican-American female engineer to work at NASA was initially hired. Both women are known for their remarkable contributions to early U. Sspace exploration. NACA, before 1958, was segregated, prohibiting Black women from usingthe same washrooms or dining facilities as their white coworkers. Thislasted until 1958, when NACA was officially incorporated into theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, which hadprohibited segregation. Johnson became a vital member of NASA’s Space Task Group, and in 1960,she became the first woman in her department to be credited forco-authoring a research report. The report was closely written with NASAengineers, detailing the calculations needed to send a spacecraft intoorbit. Johnson would go on to contribute her expertise to various projects atNASA, including calculating the trajectory of the Freedom 7 in 1961,allowing for the first U. S astronaut to be launched into space. Computers were later introduced to compute mathematical calculations,which were used to plan the launch of the Friendship 7. However,astronaut John Glenn was weary of trusting the electronic computingdevice, requesting NASA engineers to “get the girl” to double check thecalculations. Johnson went on to manually compute all the necessarycalculations herself to ensure no hiccups occurred during Glenn’sflight. Johnson would later recall Glenn telling engineers “if she saysthe numbers are good, I’m ready to go”. The launch of the Friendship 7was a success and Glenn became the first U. S astronaut to orbit theEarth. Out of all of Johnson’s accomplishments’, her most well known feat washer contribution to the calculations needed to sync the Project ApolloLunar Module to the Apollo Command and Service Module, which wouldensure safe exit and re-entry of the Apollo spacecraft into Earth’satmosphere. These calculations were pivotal to the determination ofwhere and when the Apollo 11 was to be launched, which allowed for thesuccessful landing of the first three astronauts to ever set foot on themoon. Johnson had retired from NASA in 1986 and would live up until the age of101, passing away on February 24th, 2020. Thanks to her brilliant work,she had won and been nominated for a multitude of awards, including thePresidental Medal of Freedom awarded to her in 2015, by former U. Spresident Barack Obama. In 2016, NASA would honour her legacy by naminga building the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility. Thesame year saw the publication of the book Hidden Figures: The AmericanDream and Untold Story of The Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped WinThe Space Race, detailing the contributions of Katherine Johnson, MaryJackson and Dorothy Vaughn that allowed for the success of various U. Sspace exploration programs. The book would later be adapted by 20thCentury Fox into a movie, called Hidden Figures, that generated over200 million dollars at the box office. While Johnson would become the poster girl of the early days of NASA, itis worth remembering that the United States would have never seen suchsuccess in the Space Race had it not been for the tens ofAfrican-American women who worked in the West Area Computing Unit. Thesewomen worked tirelessly, very few receiving any recognition at all andforced to tolerate racism and sexism in the workplace; nevertheless,these women still came in and gave their all. It is thanks to women likeKatherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughn and all the women whoworked in the West Area Computing Unit, that space exploration andresearch has come such a long way, with their contributions proving thatthe sky is not the limit.

    "body": "2023/02/15 - From an idealist known for his attempts at laying the foundation forhuman migration to a different planet, Elon Musk has recently had adifficult fall from grace. Musk obtained ownership of Twitter in an all-cash acquisition buyout onApril 14th, 2022, purchased for a whooping 44 billion dollars. However,since then, he has been tied up in controversy after controversy. Take the incident where Musk tweeted a link to an article by a newspapercompany known for spreading false information, which detailedobscenities regarding American businessman Paul Pelosi, the spouse ofthe former California state representative, Nancy Pelosi. The daybefore, Pelosi had been hit in the head with a hammer in a targetedassault, sparking outrage. As of the time of writing, Musk deleted thetweet, but has not given any statements in regards to his insensitiveactions. Musk’s popularity has skyrocketed in the past few years, especiallyafter he was titled the richest man in the world, yet it seems as thoughMusk is running out of luck as he lost the title of world’s richest manto a French billionaire, Bernard Arnault. To top all of this off, Elon Musk was due to appear at the United StatesFederal Court in San Francisco on January 19th, after he was sued byTesla shareholders for a series of tweets in 2018. The class-actionlawsuit was filed on behalf of Tesla investors who owned Tesla stock fora 10-day period in August of 2018. On the 7th of August, 2018, Musk hadtweeted he had acquired the funding needed to buyout Tesla at 72 milliondollars, but this claim never materialized. Additionally, the basis ofthis lawsuit derives from the claim that the Tesla shares would not havebeen traded at such a wide range had Musk not tweeted his intent topurchase the company for 420 dollars per share, thus costing investorsmillions. All this prompted an investigation, which resulted in a 20million dollar fine for Musk and for Tesla; Musk was also forced toresign as Tesla’s chairman. All of these issues come at a difficult time for Twitter, as users areconcerned about what will become of the company following such adramatic change in ownership. Musk purchased the company with theintention of imposing looser restrictions on users, which includesunbanning Former President Donald Trump, who was previously barred fromthe platform following the storming of the United States capital onJanuary 6th, 2022. All of this is bad news for Elon Musk, yet Musk is refusing to let thisgo; his most ardent supporters, including myself, are dissatisfied withhis lack of responsibility. Having read his biography, I found itinteresting and am inspired by his willingness to take risks andchallenge the status quo all the while being an entrepreneur. As I now reflect on Musk’s recent actions, I can not help but stillappreciate all the trials and tribulations he went through and the factthat he still managed to accomplish many feats that others would nottake on. This entails Paypal, formerly known as X. com, Tesla, andSpaceX, as well as his donation of over 300 million dollars through theMusk Foundation, which is known for donating to causes such as renewableenergy, human space exploration and pediatric research. But nothing sumsup this situation better than a quote from the man himself, “I’m justtrying to think about the future and not be sad. ” "

There are many, but the one thatstands out for me is when I made a promposal, in grade 12, to one of mygood friends named Nikola. She was obsessed with dinosaurs, and so I puttoy dinosaurs in all of her classes, with a clue that led her outside toa hill, and up there I sang her a song while my other friend playedguitar and the lyrics were asking her to go to prom with me. We arestill friends to this day, and there’s probably a video out theresomewhere, but I really hope it doesn’t get resurfaced anytime soon. ” Aw, Mr. Reardon is so sweet. “That’s a great story! And what year was this?” “This would’ve been, hmm, when did I graduate, 2011, so 12 years agonow. ” Woah, I’m in grade 10, so I was 4 years old when this happened! “Why did you become a teacher?” “I became a teacher because it allowed me to explore a lot of myinterests. You know, I’ve always been interested in sports, technology,the arts, and English. There’s lots of different subjects I like andI’ve always been interested in teaching, and this gives me the chance todo all of that. But I think, more importantly, I really enjoy workingwith teenagers. I think they’re cool, I think they keep me up-to-date onwhat’s happening with the world, and I really like to help them out. Ilike to see them succeed and grow, and I like to create an environmentin class where they can have a good time while still learningsomething. ” Seems like Mr. Reardon really loves the high school atmosphere! “Can you tell us about your height and your pro sports career?” “So, I’m 6 foot 7, so that means I’m 2 meters tall if we’re using thatmetric, but I was not a professional athlete, contrary to popularbelief. I played volleyball in university, I went to Ryerson, which isnow Toronto Metropolitan University, and I had a very enjoyable timeplaying there, and I’m happy that I still get to play now at MCI in theintramural league, and I get to coach, which is a new and excitingendeavor for me. ” I guess when you’re 6’7 you have no choice but to play on the volleyballteam. “When did you get so tall?” “I think I was always, you know, in the back row of the class photo, butI really shot up when I was around 16. I’d say I had my big growth spurtand that’s when I entered my very lanky, awkward phase. “So, you’re saying I have a chance?” “Yes, everyone has a chance. Also, you’re not defined by your height. It’s just a number. ” Do you hear that MCI? Grade 10s, it’s going to be our year! “What were your past jobs and why did you leave them?” “The main job I did before teaching was TV producing. I know teenagersdon’t really watch cable anymore, but I worked on some shows that theymay have heard of, like, Breakfast Television, City News, EntertainmentTonight Canada, and ETalk, and I was a producer there. I would go outand produce shoots, do interviews with people, and work on things in thestudio and I really loved it. However, I would say I love teaching moreand in my video class I get to do a lot of things I love to do aboutthat job while still fulfilling my greater purpose as a teacher. ” No way, a technology teacher that knows how to use technology?!? “What were your hobbies and interests in high school?” “I sort of dabbled in a few different things. I played sports, I wasalso in the band, and I was a bit of a music nerd. I did a video cluband I also was in a few school plays, so I did a bit of drama as well,which was something that I miss at times. ” Seems like Mr. Reardon did a bit of everything in high school. “That concludes all of my questions. Is there anything you would liketo tell the school?” “I would like to say thank you so much for the warm welcome this firstsemester. It’s always so nerve-wracking to enter a new school as someonefrom the outside, but I felt instantly at home, and that is because thestudents, the staff, and the greater community make this a wonderfulplace to be, and I am proud to call myself a Bear. ” I can definitely say I’m glad Mr. Reardon is now an MCI Bear too!

    "body": "2023/02/15 - I have a confession to make - in my eyes, snowboarding is the imperfectwinter sport. On mountain resorts that have been built to suit skiersfor over a century, the latecomer, snowboarding, fits in just as well asa hamburger patty fits in a hotdog bun. A quick search of ‘snowboarderchairlift fails’ shows you the unsettling number of people who havefallen off; by no fault of their own. As a snowboarder, chairlifts forceyou to face forward, but have your legs pointed sideways, concocting arecipe for catastrophe. Personally, as a skier, I get an impending senseof doom whenever I sit beside a beginner snowboarder on a chairlift. On the trails themselves, snowboarding falls below skiing both from alearning and logistics standpoint. It’s proven that the learning curveof snowboarding is steeper, and that only ultra talented snowboarderscan navigate through moguls and expert terrain like a skier can. Evenlooking at snowboarding GoPro videos shows how disorienting snowboardingcan be as each turn switches between a snowboarder’s torso facing up anddown the slope. Sure, a snowboarder could laugh all at a skier all dayhobbling around in rock hard boots, which are nearly impossible todescend stairs with, but unless their name is Mark McMorris, who canland a double cork 1080° at the terrain park, snowboarders will nearlyalways find themselves second best. None of this takes anything away from the people who choose snowboarding  I know plenty of amazing folks that snowboard. I will neverdiscriminate against snowboarders, but I will put forth the unspokentruth that snowboarders will always have a disadvantage, makingsnowboarding the subpar sport it is today. With all of that in mind, I would like to provide advice to all thoseplanning to hit the slopes later this season - but take my words with agrain of salt. For the skiers - it’s never smart to provoke asnowboarder, but respect them knowing it’s out of pity. For thesnowboarders - it’s never too late to change. And to any first-timers -know that opting to ski instead of snowboard could be the best decisionof your trip. "

    "body": "2023/02/15 - I am a fan of the BBC show Black Mirror, which means I never hesitateto reference it in my daily life. Whether it’s when my friends can’tstop scrolling through TikTok while we’re sharing a meal, or when I seepeople crossing the street with their noses in their phones, mysignature catchphrase is, “This is just like Black Mirror!”. Some ofmy accusations can be quite extreme (like my vendetta against Fitbits),but when I was introduced to the platform BeReal, I couldn’t help butcompare it to the show. BeReal was developed by Alexis Barreyat and Kévin Perreau in the year2020, with the intention of creating a platform that showcases the real,unedited versions of its users. Its premise is that every single userwill be notified at the same time to take a set of two photos— one fromthe selfie camera, and one from the back-facing camera. This rang alarm bells for me the first time I heard it— everyone in theworld? On their phones? At the same time? This must be some sort ofgovernment tactic to control the mindless phone-addicted sheep that makeup our society, I thought. Okay, that’s a stretch… Or is it? Whether we want to admit it or not, the majority of our generation isaddicted to our phones to some degree. For some, this means that theyhave to play the New York Times mini every day, and for others, thismeans that they can’t sit through a class without checking their phoneevery minute. According to Statistics Canada, in 2018, 97. 9% of Canadians aged 15-24had a cellphone, 72. 6% of whom checked their phone right before bed. Iam no stranger to this— in fact, I have developed a penchant for 1:00a. m. viewings of videos of Reddit threads that overlay a Subway Surfersgame in the background. This is a phenomenon that I am sure many membersof our generation have become partial to as well. 57. 5% of the total 97. 7% checked their phone at least every thirtyminutes, and 64. 6% used their phone while they watched TV. This wouldhave sounded absurd to me as a child— it doesn’t make sense to interactwith TV and another form of media simultaneously— but now, Iunderstand. I can’t tell if it’s a need for sensory stimulation, or ifit’s a fear of missing out, but I’ll find myself on my phone when I sitdown to watch TV: tapping through the Instagram stories, saving pins tomy future house board on Pinterest (let’s face it, I’m never going tohave an orange SMEG), even scrolling through LinkedIn—anything that’s onmy phone is game. This reveals another issue in our generation: most of us have becomeincapable of being alone without heaps of sensory stimulation to keep uscompany. When was the last time you were by yourself and didn’t listento music, or watch something on your phone, or have any form of sensoryactivity at all? To be frank, I think that we’re afraid of beingisolated with our thoughts. Maybe it feels like we’re alone in thisworld. Perhaps that’s why we rely on social media so desperately— so wecan connect with others when we need it most. But does social media really feed our innate desire to feel likevaluable members of society? Does posting a BeReal every day at the sametime as everyone else on the planet give us worth? Or do we not careabout being valued members of society and instead long for meaningfulconnections with others, the majority of which are achieved throughsocial media? Whatever your answer to those questions may be, we can still come to aconsensus— BeReal is a sign of our generation’s dependency on socialmedia— positive and negative— whether we like it, or not.

    "title": "New year, New Marty?",
    "body": "2023/02/15 - As we start the new semester, I think it’s time to examine ourpriorities, starting with MCI’s own mascot, Marty the Bear. At best, thecostume looks like a knock off of a Yogi bear specifically designed toscare children. At worst, it looks like someone skinned Freddy Fazbearfrom Five Nights at Freddies and called it a mascot. Mascots are notjust beacons (get it?) for school spirit, but symbolize the school as awhole. Yet, even the school seems ashamed of Marty. When is the lasttime you remember them uncaging our favorite bear-shaped terror? Ibelieve it to be the prime time to replace Marty and through intensiveresearch, I have narrowed down the list to four lucky contestants. Admittedly, I have never competed in or attended any MCI sports matches,but I don’t see how this could be a problem. Avatar’s Alien Race: Na’vi I have noticed a time honored tradition of modeling sports team mascotsafter instantly recognizable figures from history, such an example beingthe Michael Power Trojans. Marty the Bear lacks the cultural relevanceof historical figures that the Trojan mascot has. So, in search of thiscultural relevance, I suggest we at Martingrove follow this tradition,but take it a step further by looking into the future. I say we harnessundeniable cultural relevance and model our mascot off of the Na’vi, thealien race in the hit franchise Avatar. Kiefer Sutherland Many high schools have found success with having a cute and friendlylooking mascot such as the Runnymede Raven. Marty is a good attempt tofit in with this trend. However, we need to stand out, we need to makeour mark on the mascot world. How do we do that? We choose the cutest,friendliest animal Canada has to offer: famous actor and notableMartingrove alumni Kiefer Sutherland. He radiates friendliness andapproachability in his roles as the bully in Stand By Me, thebloodthirsty killer in Freeway and as the literal bloodthirsty vampirein the Lost Boys. I’m sure that a felt effigy of him will certainlycapture the cute innocence of his roles as the assassin in DesertSaints and as the assassin in Confession. If we capture a fraction ofhis gentle and non-intimidating aura, this mascot will definitely be onethat students will want to introduce to their younger siblings. The Existential Terror of Global Warming Mascots are a great secret weapon in sports. Many teams like theOakville Trafalgar Devil have chosen to take inspiration fromfrightening religious figures and incorporate them into their mascots. This is, of course, a great scare tactic… who wouldn’t be afraid of ateam that bested a devil that paraded around their enemies, forcing itto dance to Today’s Top 40 before games? Martingrove will mostdefinitely see an influx of successful home-games if we harness thefrightening power of mascots by choosing to instill a deep fear in theheart of every sports team we play against in the future. What could dothis better than existential terror about the future promised by globalwarming? How will we portray the concept of global warming? Well, that’sout of my department! However, I hope the costume will reference DougFord getting rid of the carbon tax in Ontario. Marty Again As I came up with ideas and reviewed mascots, I came to an epiphany. Irealized why we have mascots in the first place. It isn’t about havingthe cutest or most memorable or scariest mascot. It’s about having aconnection with the school. Marty may be a little worse for wear and I’mnot sure if I have ever seen him actually “in the felt” before but, hedoesn’t need to appear all the time for his presence to be felt. He isin the BAC’s yearly “bear crawl”, he is in the sign above the techhallway that says ‘Home of the Bears’, but, most importantly, he is inevery Martingrove student’s heart. "

This year, with aroster filled with a multitude of grade twelves, there was a feelingthat this would be the peak year. Expectations were high, by MCIstandards, with coach Vujacic saying that the team had a very good shotat a tie, and that the team could score at least 4 goals. The fullinterview can be found on the Instagram page @mci. hockey. They had an incredible first game, exceeding all expectations by winningthe team’s first game in four years against Silverthorn CI, by awhopping score of 7-1. The next game was the first real test, playingagainst a very tough Etobicoke CI roster, featuring coach Vujacic’s ownson. The team fought tirelessly and managed to get a close 3-2 win. Oneproblem during the game occurred when the starting goalie, Evan Cherry,collided with a player while saving a breakaway shot. He suffered aminor head injury, but finished the game strong. Later, in one of hisown hockey games, he took a shot to the head and left the ice with aconcussion. This led to needing a backup goalie to play against the bestteam, Humberside CI. Luckily, none other than the very person who iswriting this article stepped in. Not so luckily, it was my first gameever. Despite being hit in the head 3 times during warm up, I managed toput in a solid performance, only allowing 12 goals in while saving atleast 25 in a 12-2 loss. Not too bad for a rookie. This year, MCI students are allowed to view behind the scenes footage ofthe team, with the managers operating a team page on Instagram thatarguably rivals certain teams in the NHL. With a different dress code every game, MCI is always the most stylishteam there. The team has rocked suits for business casual day, beachattire for beach day, and the ugliest sweaters possible on ugly sweaterday. With access to post-game team celebrations, as well as seeing thebest “player of the game” receive the team tiara after each tournament,our hockey team has become one of the most popular sports teams at MCI. The team faces a tough schedule, but for now, let’s just sit back andenjoy some of the best hockey MCI has ever seen. "

This is why Ihave curated a list of books that should have something everyone willenjoy. A memoir that is both entertaining, insightful, and funny: You Can’t Be Serious by Kal Penn, recounts his experience of being aman of colour in the entertainment industry. While keeping the tone ofthe book mostly lighthearted, Kal looks at both his career’s mostsatisfying moments– such as how he worked for President Obama’sadministration– and the challenges he faced along the way. A good dystopian novel that isn’t The Hunger Games: Legend by Marie Lu is a fast paced story with twists you could neveranticipate. Set in a dystopian North America that has been split up intothe Republic and the Colonies, the story follows the point of view oftwo teenagers; June, one of the Republics’ wealthiest members, and Day,the Republics’ most wanted criminal. The differences in their socialstanding give them no reason to interact, until June’s brother ismurdered, and Day is the prime suspect. With amazing story telling andan intriguing plot, Lu will keep you captivated long after you finishreading the first installment in the trilogy. A fantasy that actually makes sense in the first 100 pages: Leigh Bardugo’s clear and compelling storytelling makes Shadow andBone a fantastic novel to start reading fantasy. In this plot drivenstory we follow Alina Starkov in a world that easily sticks out becauseof the personifications of light and darkness, as well as theunmistakably unique magic system. We join Alina as she picks up newskills and learns more about herself and her powers. This helps uscomprehend her growth throughout the book and how it happens. A Netflixshow adaptation has also been created that includes content from theauthor’s other book to even further engage us in this creative world. A book unlike anything you have probably ever read before: When you’re in the jungle and a little girl appears seemingly out ofnowhere, repeatedly telling you she likes your face, she may just planto steal it. In Beasts of Prey by Ayana Gray, we are taken by surpriseby many things including the scenario I just mentioned. We followalongside sixteen-year-old Koffi and seventeen-year-old Ekon, who areboth after a beast that has plagued the city of Lkossa for nearly adecade. Unable to hunt it alone, they join together in this Africanmythology inspired fantasy. The journey takes them places they nevercould have anticipated and forces them to confront things they’d ratherkeep hidden. With us all being settled one month into the new year, what is a betternew hobby to pick up on other than reading? In all of these books thereis so much more to unpack, so I strongly urge you to read them! "

    "title": "Being Gifted Doesn't Make You Special",
    "body": "2023/02/15 - One day, in grade three, a teacher came by my classroom and told me tofollow her. I was absolutely petrified— never in my five years of studyhad I done anything wrong, so what could this be? I was brought to an empty classroom at the end of the hall, where apsychologist poked and prodded at my mind. She studied me as I playedwith coloured blocks, and asked me bizarre questions, like whatdemocracy meant to me (as a Sonia Sotomayor-idolizing seven-year-old, Ihad lots to say). A few days later, my mum received a phone call, informing her that I wasgifted. When she broke the news to me on our walk home, I was elated— Ihad been told that I was special my whole life, and now there waspaperwork to prove it. I felt like Harry Potter receiving his Hogwarts acceptance letter,except I wasn’t in denial that I was special—in fact, I even felt thatit was my right to be gifted, a scholarly manifest destiny, of sorts. Ihad been academically ahead of my peers for a while— reading texts thatwere far above my grade level, and doing math problems in my head thatothers needed paper to solve. But that was because my family had broughtme up that way. My older brother, an English major, had introduced me toadvanced texts at a young age, and my father, a former professor, wouldsit down with me every night to do math problems of his own invention. Ihad been shaped into a so-called “gifted learner” because that’s justhow my family raises their kids[1]. It is after this event that I developed what I like to call “Jeff Wingersyndrome”. Jeff Winger is a character on the NBC show Community, whohas always believed that he is special. However, a pivotal turning pointin the series (the pottery episode), makes him realize that he is justlike everyone else. My Winger-esque deception disintegrated in front ofmy eyes this year. Prior to Grade Eleven, I was one of those students— I didn’t study fortests or try on assignments, and yet I wormed my way to the top of theclass. I wasn’t used to pushing myself in school because academics weresomething that came naturally to me. However, this year, with five APcourses, more leadership roles in extracurriculars, and a new part-timejob, I was, for the first time, struggling academically. My grades dropped from the high nineties to the seventies, I lost sleepover the most mundane homework questions, and I would sit through aphysics class without understanding a single thing. Most devastatingly,I realized that I was just the same as everyone else. The gifteddesignation on my IEP had no meaning anymore. I wasn’t magically stayingon top of all of my work as I had before; I was sinking— drowning, even—and I was pulling my grades and mental health down with me. Because ofmy “giftedness”, I wasn’t used to trying, so this year, when trying wasmy only option, it was as if I had forgotten how. I realized that Ididn’t know how to study for tests or manage my time wisely because Ihad gotten by without doing so in the past. I am now on the path of recovery from the inflated ego that the giftedprogram burdened me with. I am learning that I, too, am human and thatI, too, have flaws. Isn’t it hilarious that I’m learning that at agesixteen? Maybe it would have broken my heart, but I can’t help but wonder whatwould have happened if someone had humbled me early on. What if someonehad told seven-year-old Skyler, with her arsenal of World War Two factsand Harry Potter lore, that she wasn’t special? Would I have cried,telling them that they were wrong and that my mum said otherwise? Or,would I have listened to them, erasing the picture-perfect image I hadconstructed of myself in my head? I can’t say for sure; I was an emotional kid. But, what I can say isthis: I wish someone told me that I was normal earlier. [1] This brings up the important discussion of nature vs. nurture— arechildren inherently gifted, or is it a matter of their environment? Ibelieve entirely that any child who grew up in my household would turnout to be “gifted”— with piano lessons, library camp (yes, this is areal thing, and yes, I went every summer), and math enrichment classes,it would be pretty difficult for any child raised by my parents to turnout “normal”. I also am a firm believer that I would fail the giftedtest if I were to take it again at this point in my life. "

    "title": "What Makes a Cult Classic?",
    "body": "2022/12/29 - My definition of a “cult classic” is a movie that makes you say “thisdumpster fire of a trash movie is a blight upon my existence. I hate it with the burning passion of a thousand suns. Coincidentally this is the 7th time I have watched it this week”. These are the perfect movies for watching with friends, with required viewing including the ever popular “Rocky Horror Picture Show” and “The Room”. If you’re graced with chance to watch the “Rocky Picture Show” in theatres, the first thing you will notice is the flood of people dressed up as characters from the film, who are passionate about throwing rice during the wedding scene. Recent movies like the Netflix film, “Do Revenge”, received thecontradictory title of “instant cult classic” from critics. The misuse of this term brings me nothing more than mental agony, as the point of what truly makes a “cult classic” is entirely missed. The term has traditionally been used to describe a movie that campy or odd. What’s important to remember about cult classics is the connection they find with outsiders, like the passionate rice-throwing fans of the “Rocky Horror Picture Show”. Streaming services heavily contribute to the recent acceleration ofmovies being declared “cult classics” before the end of their box office weekend. Streaming makes it easier to have access to films for those with genuine interest, which in turn also makes it easier for these movies to become mainstream. So, is it the end of cult classics? As I pondered this question, anunexpected challenger appeared: “Minions: The Rise of Gru”. The “Gentle Minions” trend, where groups of people dressed up in their least wrinkled suits to attend screenings of the film, eerily paralleled those who dressed up to attend the “Rocky Horror Picture Show”. However, the media hype around this trend reeked of corporate interference and not a grassroots movement created out of genuine interest. The unique thing about cult classics is regardless of however low-budget or peculiar they are, it’s evident there is passion behind them, giving those films a sort of charm that no “instantcult classic” could ever replicate. So, if you want to watch a movie, take my advice and try a cult classic. By the end you will be saying “Let’s do the time warp again”. "

Even though many Christmasmovie classics have lost the vibrant aura they once had, Spirited’smodern, musical twist on Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” offers aflamboyant film that will get your foot tapping. This big and boisterousmusical comedy offers an exciting holiday movie option worth checkingout for its punchlines and emotional quality. It’s the first time “A Christmas Carol” is told from the perspective ofthe ghosts of Christmas, and this interpretation stars Will Ferrel asthe protagonist: the Ghost of Christmas Present, addressed as Present. Present stumbles upon Clint Briggs, played by Ryan Reynolds, an oilybusinessman who specializes in crafting controversy. Present identifiesClint as the perfect candidate for the ghosts’ next “perp”. Each year’s“perp”, a Scrooge-like individual to be haunted every Christmas, isoffered a shot at redemption. While the film has a playful overlying tone and a Broadway feel, theabundance of times characters burst into song took away from thestoryline during the first third. Additionally, the plot is messy attimes and confusing. Yet Ferrel and Reynolds have stellar chemistry, andthe emotions Spirited spills out are one of its best traits. Reynoldsembodies Clint’s smart-aleck personality like we’ve seen before inDeadpool. Spirited may not be an instant Christmas classic, but it’smore than a soon-to-be-forgotten streaming stocking stuffer. It’s wellworth a watch to pass your time this winter break, and it can be foundon Apple TV+ rated PG-13. Movie Rating: ★★★☆☆ 3. 5 stars "

    "title": "Stress Management",
    "body": "2022/12/29 - What is stress? In your Physics class stress is the weight or tension exerted on an object; in your English class it might refer to the emphasis or importance of a word in a sentence. But that’s not the stress most of us think of when we talk about stress. I-haven’t-studied-for-my-test stress, I-haven’t-marked-all-those-tests stress, I-have-no-idea-what-I-am-doing-for-the-holidays stress. What is this type of stress? What causes it? And is there a way out ofit? Let’s start with a working definition of this mental stress – a tensionor imbalance in the mental fabric of a sentient being. What causes it?In the words of one of my teachers- it is caused by giving UNWISEattention or emphasis to the faults in others, situations, or yourself. No one is saying the people you deal with (teachers/ parents/ friends/students/ colleagues/ or you yourself) are perfect. It requires criticalthinking to know what is right and what is wrong, so you are smart toknow just what is wrong here. It is a moral imperative that we dosomething about situations that need correction, so you are beingmorally responsible in wanting to change the things that need to bechanged. But walking around in moral indignation at everything that iswrong with the world – is not the path of wisdom. If you find yourselfstressed out – chances are you have acquired a high degree of expertisein ‘fault finding’. While it is a useful skill to have, like any othertool it needs to be under the conscious control of its handler. Then theway out of our stress is the wisdom to give only skillful attention tothe faults in people and situations – just as much as is needed – notmore, not less. This is the training that needs to be undertaken. Unfortunately, as a society we spend so much time learning math,science, and English but not enough in learning about our own mental –emotional states. We expect students to focus, concentrate, payattention, but we rarely ever teach them HOW to pay attention in thefirst place. Fortunately, this is a problem that has been encountered,examined, and solved by ancient civilizations. The eastern paradigm proposes a trifold approach to work yourself out ofstress – 1-by training in moral conduct, 2- by training in the art ofpaying attention, and 3- by training in the wisdom that discerns what topay attention to. So how does one start on the path? you ask. Well, finda teacher. The voice of another is the first requirement for most of usto even begin to comprehend that stress is not inevitable, it is notnatural, and it is not a compulsory question on this test of life. It isoptional. I can choose to live a life free of stress, it is possible, itis plausible, and with the right effort it is easily verifiable foroneself. "

    "body": "2022/12/29 - Most people associate December holidays with Christmas or Hanukkah, butthere is a lot more to the month than that. The holiday of Ashura is very important in the Islamic faith, especiallyfor the Shia sect of Islam, in which it is the most important day of theIslamic calendar and a day of mourning. Sunnis observe the holiday byfasting in solidarity with Moses and the Israelites during their exodusfrom biblical Egypt. Yule or Yuletide, the precursor to Christmas, may be a more familiarholiday. Pagan religions celebrate this holiday that represents theWinter Solstice and Father Yule, who was thought to be Odin or Wodan, isthe head of the celebration. Many Christmas traditions, such as theChristmas tree, mistletoe, the wreath we put on our door, and SantaClaus, who, like Wodan, has a large white beard and owns a flyingreindeer, originated in Yule. In my own religion, Hanukkah is one of my favorite holidays, perhapsbecause it is our only holiday that does not involve sitting in anuncomfortable chair for four hours. I get to eat delicious fried donuts,sufganiyot (jelly-filled donuts) and latkes (potato pancakes), and I cangamble with chocolate when playing with dreidels. The next holiday afterHannukah, Tu B’Shevat, is the day of trees, which entails planting atree in Israel. In the end there’s a lot to do this Winter, whether youcelebrate Christmas, Kwanzaa, or National Llama Day. Happy Holidays! "

It was snowing, and Christine Falmerwas dead. That’s the first thing I always think of. The snow wasunexpected; it had been a warm year, but that night there were nearlyfifty centimetres. And of course, Christine Falmer was dead. Christine was the girlfriend of my friend, Den and boy, she was hot. Okay, sorry, I know that sounds bad. I didn’t really know her, I mustconfess. But I liked her. Everybody liked her. To be honest with you,I don’t know anyone who really knew her, except Den. Den never reallysaid much about her. Anyways, back to the story. It was snowing, and Christine Falmer wasdead. The cops found her frozen in a snowbank, with blood everywhere. Yet, there weren’t any wounds to be found on her body. That’s whateveryone agreed on, even Gene Kravitz, who thought they faked the moonlanding and that vaccines gave you herpes. I guess that doesn’t soundvery reliable when you think about it, but the point is everyone elseagreed with him, this time. When she was found everyone went crazy for a bit. Mom demanded I be homeby five, but that proved to be unnecessary. The cops announced a curfewthe next day. I find it funny now, that they thought that would make anydifference. Christine Falmer died at noon. Of course, no one knew thatthen, so I can’t fault them for it. I just find it funny. We kids were scared too. I stayed at Den’s house most of the day, withMalek and Francisco too. That’s where I heard about the monster. Malek was the one who saw it first. He told us, in hushed tones, that hehad seen a stranger with a red coat around town in the weeks leading upto Christmas. “Red leather, like a biker. ” He told us that he lookednormal at first, but then Malek caught a glimpse of his eyes, and theman changed, somehow. I was skeptical, but then Den and Francisco shared their stories. I wasthe only one who hadn’t seen the man in the red leather coat. A bit of background is needed for this next part. I’ve always been a bitof an odd kid. I was the kind of kid the teacher made sit alone becauseI never got along with others. Den adopted me, and since Malek andFrancisco were his friends, I hung out with them. Yet, after all my timespent with them, I never could shake the feeling that I was the odd oneout. One night, I left Den’s house early after I spent the evening over. Ifelt alone even though all my friends were present. I walked along thegray sidewalk in the dark when I finally saw him. When I saw the man, hedidn’t just look at me. I remember his eyes opening wider than they hadany right to and his sockets being filled with jagged, bloody teeth. Never in my life had I wanted to cry, curl up and die, as badly as I didat that moment. The feeling of loneliness and fear swallowed me as Iclosed my eyes as tight as I could, anticipating the worst. When Ifinally opened them, the monstrous man had been replaced by ChristineFalmer. She looked five, maybe six, and held out her hand to me. Ireached for it. Yet, something felt deeply wrong, I felt like somethingterrible was drawing me in like I was sinking in molasses, but I didn’tcare. I suddenly didn’t feel so lonely, for once in my life I feltwhole. that drug-like feeling was stronger than any doubts. To this day, I am not 100 percent sure if I truly did see Christine thatnight, but I am sure that I would have been dead had it not been forMalek, Den, and Franc. The memory remains a haze, but one minute I wasreaching for Christine’s hand, and the next I was laying in a puddle ofblood, I’m not sure whose. I was desperately clinging to consciousness,and all I could hear was the struggle of the three as they wrestled theman in the red leather coat. I was never filled in on what truly happened that night. We allacknowledged the horror brought on by that night but the event was neverrecounted. All I know is the man fled, to where I have no idea. Denmanaged to get a piece of the man’s jacket during the struggle, and itwas full of writhing maggots. The boys brought me home to my panicked and worried mother. She criedand hugged us all when she found out what happened. Whether or not shebelieves us is up for debate but she never questioned me about it. Iasked Den how they’d found me, and he said they were worried after Ileft so quickly and they decided to go after me. Den never quite got over Christine. Her abrupt death and the shut andclosed case would plague him for years to come. We concluded that weknew exactly what had happened to Christine, and we visit her graveevery year with flowers. Ever since that fateful night, I no longer feel lonely. I no longer feellike the odd one out. I no longer feel so scared. I’m more alive thanever. "

That’s the question many MCI studentsare asking themselves right now. The boys’ volleyball season has justended and it’s time for the girls’ season to start. So once again,students are hearing announcements about volleyball over the P. A. On topof that, the volleyball intramurals are gearing up. To recap the boys’ volleyball season, the senior boys made it all theway to the West Region semi-finals, eventually losing to Silverthorn,who became the champions. Some students described the Silverthorn teamas, “a team of full-grown men,. ” considering the larger build of theirplayers. The junior boys also had a successful season, booking theirticket to the West Region semi-finals with a triumph againstSilverthorn. On the fun side of volleyball, here’s some inside information on whichteams to watch in the intramural season. The “Papa Pavle”, otherwiseknown as the “University of Wisconsin” entry, is fielding an extremelystrong roster and may make it to the top tier if they end up competingat all (more on that later). The “Twirly Burlies 2” could make a strongrun for it, with a star-studded roster including one of the best grade10 athletes. Lastly, the “Tier One Dustbuckets” may be good contendersafter their acquisition of a star libero and setter. Could the Papa Pavle team be disqualified due to a ‘cheating’ scandal?Apparently, an unnamed member of the team forged signatures for each ofthe players, using the same pen and style of writing— making itpainfully obvious that the signatures were forged. If so, that was aseriously rookie mistake. We hope to see you at the games cheering on your school. Go MCI! "

At the beginning of this year, it might have been cold and dark, but at least we started recovering from the pandemic. School was stressful for many of us in spring, but once tests and culminations were done, July seemed closer than ever. With the end of the school year came the summer break; but unfortunately, summer came and went far too quickly. Nonetheless, it was still fun. You know what comes next. The start of school was nerve-wracking andexciting at the same time. We all remember how stressed and annoyed wewere as we waited in the long line outside the guidance office. Yet, thefirst day of school was still refreshing. Watching the grade ninesrunning around with seemingly limitless energy never gets old. After awhile, though, everyone started to miss those warm summer days. Unfortunately, it will be a while before we can get those back. With thebeginning of school came cold, wet, autumn mornings and dark afternoons,but spirits still ran high until the dreaded midterms. Hopefully,nobody did too badly. Soon after the anguish of report cards was over, the first snowfalloccurred, forcing everyone to bundle up in jackets and sweaters andprepare for the cold. Of course, there are those few psychopaths who gooutside in -20°C weather wearing only a hoodie and flannel pyjamabottoms. Now, here we are, saying goodbye to our friends and preparing for along, well-deserved winter break. After all that has happened in 2022,we can finally sit back and enjoy the final few days before the newyear. Happy holidays Martingrove! Stay safe. "

    "title": "Verity: Colleen Hoover’s Pathetic Attempt at a Romantic Thriller",
    "body": "2022/12/29 - Colleen Hoover. You either know exactly who she is or this name is absolutely foreign to you. If you have any interest in reading, and actively use social media platforms like Tiktok, you are bound to be familiar with at least some of Hoover’s work. She’s known for her young adult romance novels that aren’t afraid to touch on taboo subject matter. Her wildly popular series “It Ends With Us” being an excellent example, touching on the complexities of the trauma brought on by domestic abuse. I first heard of the book Verity earlier this year from an instagramreel that briefly detailed the horrors encompassed within the threehundred and fourteen page novel. I, being someone with a life-longpassion for indulging in disturbing literature, had concluded that Ineeded to get my hands on this book one way or another. Soon enough Ifound the book on clearance at Walmart. Whether my prayers had beenanswered or I had been bestowed with a curse was debatable. I read itfrom cover to cover within a matter of seventy-two hours. I have neverpicked up a work by Colleen Hoover again. I detest spoilers, therefore, I am warning the readers of potentialspoilers. The novel opens with the gut-wrenching line of “I hear thecrack of his skull before the splattering of blood reaches me. ” Thisdisturbing first line cages the reader’s attention as the novelcontinues on by following the protagonist, Lowen Ashleigh, a strugglingauthor living in New York, who is offered to complete the last threebooks in the popular “The Noble Virtues” series, written by VerityCrawford, who was left unable to complete the series after an accident. Lowen accepts the offer, and is invited by Verity’s attractive husband,Jeremy, to come and stay with him, Verity and their young son, as shescavenges Verity’s office for anything that could help her complete thebook series. However, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript written by Veritythat was never intended to be seen by anyone. The manuscript containsdetails of Verity’s life from the first day she met Jeremy and goes intohorrific detail about the death of Verity’s autistic daughter a fewmonths after the death of her twin sister. The manuscript is packed withsickening passages entailing the twisted and disturbed mind of Verity asshe navigates her relationship with Jeremy and her absolute hatred formotherhood. Hoover’s novel spans three hundred and fourteen pages with only onehundred pages contributing to the plot. The remainder is mostly cringeworthy sex scenes between Jeremy and Lowen or Jeremy and Verity. It isimpressive how much smut Hoover was able to squeeze into a novel about adelirious women who potentially murdered her autistic daughter. Sexwithin literature can add to the plot or add more depth to a character. However, this is all pointless sex that does nothing for the plot. Iwant to know why Verity felt as though her twin daughters were competingagainst her to gain her husband’s affections, not how many differentways it’s humanly possible to have intercourse. Though the premise of the plot itself has kept me on edge for the entireduration of the book, Hoover focused more on the explicit scenes ratherthan properly executing the plot, especially with the ending. Thisresulted in the story contradicting itself at times, leaving the readerless thrilled and more confused. I also found that the romance betweenLowen and Jeremy felt rushed and forced onto the readers. The reader isbarely three pages into the book when they are already bombarded withhints at a potential relationship between the two. Additionally,Hoover’s novel is written in a casual style, and occasionally herpotential as a writer shines through with her use of commentary. Hooveris excellent at writing about situations and the feelings they evokeemotions. However, there isn’t much of anything beyond that. “Trauma p*rn” is an internet term used to describe media in whichcharacters seem to go through never-ending pain and suffering. This termis an excellent way to describe the lack of dimension Hoover gives toher characters, with their only depth being how sad and traumatized theyare. The three main characters of the novel all fit into cliches seenagain and again within the young adult fiction category; theself-absorbed diva, the not-so-smart hunk and the shy nerd who is thepolar opposite to the diva. Although, to give Hoover some credit,Verity’s character is the most well developed, as the book does anexcellent job at painting her as a beautiful and successful writer whodeep down is a psychopath unable to feel any compassion for her ownblood and flesh. Colleen Hoover’s work proved lackluster, leaving me with a sense that Ihave finished reading a semi-well written Wattpad fanfiction. Her workis nothing extraordinary, and it’s in her best interest she leavesthrillers to more skillful authors. "

I mean, the stressing over deadlines, staying up until dawn to study, and the exhausting socializing hasn’t worn me out at all. If you are looking for a good example of high school life that may not differ just a little from our reality, check out these five films. 1. Mean Girls Almost everyone has seen the iconic Lindsay Lohan &amp; Rachel McAdamsclassic. We all know girls can be powerful masterminds with zeroremorse. Except I can’t recall the last time I’ve seen someone getpushed in front of a bus. It must’ve happened that time I was home sick. 2. High School Musical Ah yes, the movie I was convinced would be my own high school experiencein a nutshell when I was age nine. If you weren’t watching this movieand fantasizing about high school being exactly the same, then what wereyou doing? 3. Camp Rock Those who went to the leadership camp understand everything this moviewas about. The camp colours were battling it out trying to beat eachother to become the ultimate camp-rocker with musical wisdom andknowledge. Not so far off from the actual movie. 4. 10 Things I Hate About You This movie hits all the marks for a teenager’s high school encounter:cliché high school parties, a messy relationship, and a girl boss momentwhere you use an emotional poem to get back at the guy who broke yourheart. I’m not sure about the guy pretending to date me for cold hardcash though. 5. Carrie There are honestly so many similarities between this movie and real lifehigh school. I see girls walking around the hallway, drenched in blood,wearing a prom dress all the time. Okay, so maybe this one is a bit of astretch, but imagine if it actually happened. "

The confidence they had in interrupting a lesson aboutRemembrance Day to complain about their first-world problems made theteacher understand why we remember. July 28, 1914. World War I caused everyone physically present in 1914 tobe wounded in some way, either mentally or physically. People of allsocial groups, races, and ages were impacted by this warfare. Those whosurvived the combat experienced life-long psychological torment, whilethe soldiers who died had their last glimpse of the world as gauzyclouds of smoke. Whilst soldiers in 1914 slept in their tents, reciting childhood prayersin hopes of being able to live one more night, today’s children have theluxury of being able to sleep without the fear of tonight being theirlast. Without remembering their struggles, the fight for freedom in 1914would be forgotten, just like the teacher who realized that colouringpoppies would not teach these children why we remember. "

For one thing, 16 out of 25 councilors were re-elected as incumbents,unsurprisingly. Mayor John Tory won a third term with a whopping a 40point victory over his nearest competitor. Most of the politicians whowere re-elected won by either a really small or large margin, includingthe counselor in my ward, Anthony Peruzza, who defeated the person insecond place by 40% and has served on the city council since 2006. Herein Etobicoke Centre, Steven Holyday won again, serving his 3rd term andbeating the competition by 60% of the vote. It was noted in an article from the CBC that there is a reduction inpolling stations throughout the city. Toronto had 1,700 voting locationsin the previous election in 2018, but this year, despite the city’spopulation explosion, it is down to 1,460 voting locations. This mayhave been one factor in the historically low voter turnout. Only 29% ofeligible voters cast ballots. There were some changes. An example of this is Ausma Malik, who won theseat in Spadina-Fort York, becoming the first Muslim woman on CityCouncil. In conclusion, while there have been some changes, the apparentvoter apathy as well as major challenges faced by the mayor and councilcould make for an interesting four years. "

    "body": "2022/11/21 - Diwali is an auspicious Hindu festival, also known as the “festival oflights,” celebrating the return of King Rama after defeating the evilRavana. On Wednesday October 26th, MCI’s South Asian Cultural Association (SACA)shared a piece of their culture with us by organizing a samosa sale andhenna booth. The line extended from the parking lot entrance doors in the foyer tothe Bear’s Den. Students faced the risk of being trampled over by therestlessly hungry crowd. Nonetheless, they prioritized the samosas overthemselves. Were the Samosas Worth It? As a lifetime Indian, I give this samosa my stamp of approval. Thesesamosas perfectly balance the spices, and the veggies to potato ratio,capturing the taste and the essence of an authentic version of thisSouth Asian delicacy. Henoc from Grade 12 rates the Samosas “10/ 10” as“ [t]hey were fire. ” The dish was well seasoned, perfectly spiced to not make you cry, butenough to make your mouth water. According to Muna in Grade 12, “All thespices come together beautifully. ” Some disagreed, such as Hibaaq fromGrade 11 who thought that the samosa was “very tasteful, but needed morepepper. ” The portion sizes could have been a little better to make for a morefilling snack. However, you can always buy more as the prices werejaw-droppingly good. Two samosas for just a dollar! Inflation seems tonot have caught up with these samosa prices. Overall Rating: 4. 5/5 Follow @mcisaca on Instagram to be reminded about future SACA Samosasales. Pro Tip- Come a few minutes early to beat the rush and get chutneybefore it runs out. "

During this event, gold ribbons with pins were given out to each studentwho wrote something on one of these posters so they could represent theRelay for Life club.

    "body": "2022/11/21 - Midnights makes its mark as Taylor Swift’s tenth album, and the firstnew music since she began rerecording her previous works in 2021. Thisis huge news for Swifties, since there hasn’t been anything new sincethe releases of Folklore and Evermore in 2020. Swift describes thisalbum as being autobiographical, showcasing her deepest insecurities,all the while bringing back the lively air of her chart-topping lovesongs of the 2010s. Midnights is coined as “a collection of music written in the middle ofthe night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams,” which consistsof thirteen tracks. Track by track, anticipation built, and on October7th the tracklist was completed:  Lavender Haze Maroon Anti-Hero Snow on the beach (ft. Lana Del Rey) You’re on Your Own Kid Midnight Rain Question…? Vigilante Sh*t Bejeweled Labyrinth Karma Sweet Nothing MastermindFans around the world eagerly awaited for midnight on October 21st,wanting to be the first to indulge in Swift’s creative talents. Afterthat very first listen, people went online to post opinions, songrankings, their favorite lyrics, and then likely retired to bed. Thetruly dedicated Swifties who stayed up until 3 am, were met with a verychaotic surprise, as promised by Swift herself. Seven new songs werereleased three hours after the original thirteen.  The Great War Bigger Than The Whole Sky Paris High Infidelity Glitch Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve Dear ReaderThese songs, although not on the original tracklist, still follow thetheme of self-reflection and contemplation. Similar to the “From theVault” tracks featured in her rerecordings, these songs are extracontent which were likely too extensive to add onto the official list. With the original tracklist taking up forty-eight minutes, theadditional songs would make the total tracklist over an hour long. Although Midnights was an amazing album, there have been more than afew online criticisms. Many thought that this album would be like herprevious two, which were very lofty, whimsical, and showed us a side toSwift’s music we hadn’t seen before. But people were surprised to hearthe bouncy pop opening of Lavender Haze. Not to mention the noticeablelack of Lana Del Rey in Snow On The Beach, which was a critical factoras to why the song was heavily promoted. Fans had been anticipating acollaboration between the two, and were severely disappointed when allthat was heard was faint whispers behind Swift’s vocals. But then again,don’t let the negative reviews stop you from enjoying the album. Listenfor yourself, and let the haters hate. Despite fan speculations, there will probably be a long period of timebefore we hear anything new from Taylor again. With four rerecordingsstill outstanding and hopes of a tour, it seems like this artist has alot on her plate. Until then, Swifties should appreciate the twenty newsongs and appreciate Swift’s dedication to her art, her fans as well asreflect on her incredible musical career. "

She was knownto create a friendly environment and have a positive influence on thosearound her. Jireh was always supportive of anyone, no matter who theywere, even if she did not know them. She was also an amazing leader atchurch. It would not matter where she was or who she was with, she wouldalways show friendliness and was always approachable. She was alwaysadmired for her initiative, co-operation, and perseverance in anysituation. At Martingrove Collegiate Institute, she had become closewith many. Jireh’s teachers and friends have shared many fond memoriesof her. Here is what they had to say: “It’s been a privilege to teach two members of the Leal family. Ithought very highly of the bond between Jai and Judah, and having themboth in the same class this year gave me a front seat to a loving,incredulous, safeguarded relationship only siblings can have. She showedheart in both her care for her musical craft, and the connections shecultivated with those around her, and I count myself so blessed to be inthose numbers. ” - Ms. J. Chang “I will always remember Jireh as a bright and kind student with abeautiful smile. I was so proud of her as a blue camper up at Manitoulast month— her incredible energy, support, and honesty strengthened thebonds and sense of community that they built up at camp. She will bemissed. ” - Ms. S. Lima “Jireh was a lot of good things, but most of all, a wonderful friend. Itruly couldn’t have asked for anything more from her as a friend, andI’m grateful beyond belief for her being there for me. ” - Rudi Mataj “Jireh was an amazing person. She lit up my day with just her cheerfulsmile, how we greet each other in the morning. She was also my sportsbuddy. She was so talented in every sport, especially volleyball. It wassuch an honor being close to her. Thanks Jai. ” - Vivian Do “Jai could do anything! Like singing, dancing, playing instruments,making stuff, arts, sports, she was an absolute golden child ateverything she did. While she did tend to lose sleep for it, I’ve alwaysbeen proud of how talented she is and she’s definitely been a personI’ve looked up to because she’s so all rounded. ” - KavinayaVijayatharsan “I loved your laugh and your funny jokes. I loved how you didn’t careabout what other people thought. I loved how caring and loving you weretowards me. We believed we were platonic soulmates. Maybe that’s why herdeath hurts so much” - Anisa Krasniqi Jireh’s death has impacted us very much and it would be very helpful inthe difficult times to support those who were close to her as well aslook to receive support. Talking to friends and family can make the mourning easier. For parents,being there for your children by sitting down, listening, acknowledging,as well as communicating can be very helpful in the grieving process. Check up on them every once in a while to see how they are dealing withthe situation and make sure to let them know that you are always thereto support them. If you’re unable to talk to peers or parents/guardians,talking to a counselor or therapist can be helpful too. Schoolcounselors will always be there at school to help you get through thesituation.

Some greatways to celebrate include dressing up, trick-or-treating, throwingawesome Halloween parties, and more. Dressing up at school might be uncomfortable (especially if you have atest), but it’s awesome when everyone is doing it. A quintessentialHalloween costume is the simple ghost with a white sheet and 2 holes init. Imagine a whole class full of ghosts; surely, all the teachers wouldlove that. Another easy costume could be wearing your sports equipmentand dressing up as a pro player, then begging your teacher to let you gooutside to showcase your skills for the class. Then, right after school,you can go to a Halloween party! Relax all day in school, then have ablast with all your friends! After that, you can go trick-or-treatingand end up with tons of candy. Please remember to look at the candy tomake sure it’s safe before mindlessly consuming it. Now, all of that work for your costume can’t go to waste. If you don’tget a chance to wear your costume at school, make sure to have a partywith a competition to show who truly has the best costume. Finally,you must, and I mean you must, watch horror movies as late as possiblewith your friends and family. It’s one of the most important parts ofthe Halloween experience. Halloween is truly one of the greatest joys in life. Just remember towear bright or reflective clothing at night so you don’t get hit by acar when you’re trick-or-treating. Also, don’t force-feed candy to yourfriends who have food allergies. Trust me on that one. "

Before I tried my first horror game, Resident Evil, I was worriedabout the jitters I would feel after playing the game, but it turned outto be not too bad. Recently, I played Resident Evil 8, which hadbetter graphics and camera angles. It has survival and mystery elementssimilar to those found in horror movies. With its mutants andcut-scenes, it had the feel of a horror movie. In the end, I did enjoythe experience of playing the game. Aside from video games, if youreally like that Halloween adrenaline rush and want to enjoy a freakyfilm to enjoy with your friends and family, I recommendJeepers,Creepers or Poltergeist. Both play on your emotions andprovide a scare element. Some horror movies leave a long-lasting effect, even years after you’vewatched them. Scary or bone-chilling horror movies are not for everyone. If you don’t want horror or at least scary, I can recommend eitherScream, WWZ, or even Scream’s parody, Scary Movie, which wasreally great. If you want to consider a musical, try The Rocky HorrorPicture Show. It is a timeless classic, although it’s not really ahorror movie.

Before weknew it, the opening ceremonies commenced, with the congratulating ofthe team $lumdog Millionaires for raising the most money while the teamsaccompanied by cancer survivors walking a lap around the school. Therest of the morning offered up a variety of choices: playing a rousinggame of water pong or snakes in ladders, going on a bounce in the bouncycastle or simply enjoying the outdoors. I took this time to play a nailbiting game of snakes and ladders. Time flew by fast, and soon we were participating in the lunch andafternoon activities: tug of war, face painting, and dodgeball, to namea few. One of the highlights of the events was the tug of war. It wasthe first time I had ever participated and it was a cool experience. Ialso really enjoyed the food provided throughout the day. They not onlygave us lunch and breakfast, but snacks too, with samosas and donutsbeing handed out later. The day ended with the closing ceremony in thegymnasium. When we entered, we were met with all the luminaries we hadmade earlier displayed in the word ‘love. ’ This was paired with anamazing performance by the Martingrove String Orchestra. The whole visual really drove home what Relay is really about. Itisn’t about the amazing food or dodgeball, it’s about finding a cure forcancer. Cancer has touched not only everyone attending, but probablyeveryone in the world. After the celebrations are over and thedecorations are cleared up, we should remember what’s truly important. That is supporting people who have cancer and cancer survivors, alongwith researching for a cure. As a school we ensure Relay has animpact. This year we raised over $14,000. This money will be used tofund cancer research and to provide a national support system for cancerpatients. At the end of the event it was clear that Martingrove as aschool is bigger than cancer.

    "body": "2022/06/22 - As the school year comes to a close, so does the 20-year teaching careerof one of MCI’s most impactful teachers: Ms. Feller. Having spent herentire time as a teacher at Martingrove, Ms. Feller has been involved incountless school clubs, sports, and activities, and has truly betteredour school community. Ms. Feller grew up in Toronto, and received a masters degree in PhysicalEducation with a minor in English from Western University. Although shehad always wanted to become an educator, it was tough to get a job as ateacher at the time. Instead, she moved to Ottawa, where she worked inthe Fitness and Amateur Sport department of the federal government. Following this, she worked for the provincial government as a Probationand Parole officer in Belleville, Ontario. It was in this role that Ms. Feller describes the way she got to understand the broader scope ofyoung people, and became interested in social work. Then, she moved backto Toronto, where she owned a lighting store and worked as a freelancetour guide on the history of Toronto and Niagara Falls. (Her favouriterecommendation to visit: the Toronto Islands, as they’re oftenundervalued, and it feels like you’ve gone somewhere completelydifferent in your own city!). It was not until later in life that Ms. Feller went back to school toget her teaching degree. With 3 kids and multiple careers under herbelt, she “had a longing and a sense of fulfillment” to become ateacher. She hoped that it was a better time to get hired, and luckilygot a contract right out of teacher’s college to work at MCI. While most people know her as the dedicated librarian, Ms. Feller beganher time at MCI teaching English and Phys-ed. . She was a then the maindrama teacher for 7 years; she taught classes, put on various musicalssuch as Grease and Chicago, and helped slowly grow the drama programthroughout these years. Ms. Feller says her first impression of ourschool was that it was big, and she felt somewhat out of place. “I felta bit lost, much like a grade 9 student! It took some time before Ifound my groove. ” In terms of her school involvement, Ms. Feller has done it all. Shestarted the TEDx club, providing an opportunity for students to speakand be heard, which was unlike any other school clubs at the time. Ms. Feller has also worked with Me to We, coached sports teams (curling andarchery), and been a staff advisor for Leadership. She has been thestaff advisor for the Beacon for a few years, working to help nurturestudent writing and advocating for the idea of voicing ideas andopinions. Finally, she has been the head of the library for over 10years, having found a great passion for it. “Once I got here, it waslike where have you been all my life! I finally found a place that Ibelieved was so important for the whole school. . The concept that aplace is here to serve the whole community is something I find verygratifying. I will really miss the library. ” The best thing about working at MCI for Ms. Feller has been working withstudents. She explains that working at the school became her life, andpart of her identity. “It is such a blessing to to go somewhere everydayand have a purpose. I’ve found this job very personal, that you show upand you’re a somebody. ” She has loved being part of school groups thatamplify student voices and highlight student work, because, “when[students] speak about what’s important to them, it teaches me what’sreally going on in the world. The opportunity to hear what they reallywant to say about anything is a gift…. We’re all learning and growingwith all this new information. We need [young people] to help usunderstand the world. ” Upon asking if Ms. Feller had any advice for students, she said this:“If you’re not sure where you’re going, that’s okay. If you’re like me,try a career, then switch gears and try the next career. . There are norules anymore! Maybe you’ll just fall into something, and it ends upbeing what you wanted or what you’re meant to do. This tremendous stressof what you’re going to be- gosh, I never knew and I just figured it outanyways. If you like it, stay. If you don’t, go. If anything, I’m theposter child for being curious and open to living your life!” Ms. Feller doesn’t have any concrete plans for herself duringretirement, and simply wants to see what kinds of doors open for her!She would also like to do some volunteer work, and possibly travel. Ms. Feller has been a dependable and influential member of the Martingrovecommunity for many years, and we wish her all the best in herretirement! “I shall pass this way but once; any good that I can do or any kindness I can show let me do it now for I shall not pass this way again. ” (Etienne de Grellet )"

    "body": "2022/06/22 - As students approach the end of another year at MCI, they also headtowards the end of this year’s athletic accomplishments andextracurriculars. With so many clubs and teams at our school, it can behard to figure out what’s going on. Before talk of next year’s plansbegin, here is a recap on all things athletic from our 2021/22 schoolyear at MCI, as well as important information about sports in general atour school. Sports and athletics have always been an important part of student lifeat Martingrove. According to Mr. Vujacic, who coaches several MCIathletic teams, sports not only provide the benefit of staying fit, butalso help in meeting other students from different grades. There is alsothe fact that students get to come to school and look forward toparticipating in something they love, in a safe and friendlyenvironment. Not only do these sports influence the individualspartaking in them, but they also raise the spirit of the people aroundthem. If you happened to attend any game this year, you know how exciteda crowd of MCI students can get. “The heartbeat of a school is oftenthe athletics, because the most students can get involved in thatsegment of extracurriculars,” Mr. Vujacic stated in an interview. Athletics help to positively impact the atmosphere of the school andimprove the general vibe. This was the first year MCI has had sports in a long time, and accordingto Mr. Vujacic, it wasn’t easy. After two years of Covid, and addedstress on all of the teachers, there have been less coaches than ever. The most important thing for extracurriculars is to have teacher coachesand as many teams as possible, in order to run as many intramurals aspossible. This gives the most number of students the opportunity toparticipate. “Nothing is more rewarding for a teacher than to have awonderful group of students doing something that they love,” Mr. Vujacic said on the subject. The coach also stated that sports wouldn’thave even been possible this year without student coaches’ help. NicoleSmythson-Shinozaki and Devanshi Patel coached both boys volleyballteams, and Emma Evans, Matthew Graydon and Anne Ruprecht coached thegirls volleyball teams. Former soccer star, Dimirti Konomis, coached thejr. boys soccer team. Perhaps you didn’t partake in any sports at MCI this year, but wouldlike to potentially try out next year. Maybe you just want to join someextracurriculars for fun or make new friends. Either way, Mr. Vujacic’sadvice is to get involved in as many sports as possible. This willprovide you more opportunities to play on various teams, including someyou may not think you would enjoy. Joining the revamped intramuralprogram next year is a great start to getting involved at MCI and makingthe high school experience more tolerable. “Hard work is usually moreimportant than skill when it comes to being a great athlete. ” Rememberthis important quote, from Mr. Vujacic, for next year’s sports seasonand for the future ones to come. In this year’s shortened season, there are fewer sports than ever. Luckily, the school was fortunate enough to continue with volleyball,basketball, soccer, track and field, ice hockey, ultimate frisbee,badminton, softball and, of course, baseball. MCI achieved great successin these sports throughout the year, including athletes’ individualaccomplishments and entire team’s accolades. MCI coaches are happy torecognize some standout achievements from this year’s student athletes.  The Senior Boys’ Soccer team was the most talented team Mr. Vujacichas coached for twenty-three years. Congratulations to the WestFinalist and to our two grade twelve superstars: Adam Brattagelloand Genti Gashi.  Anne Rupert led the Senior Girls’ Volleyball team to the Tier TwoWest Region finals.  The Varsity Boys’ Ice Hockey team played in the Tier 1 division andthe goalie, Evan Cherry, should be recognized for giving them achance to compete with the other hockey powerhouses.

    "body": "2022/05/17 - The upcoming Asian Canadian heritage month has made me think a lot aboutmy identity as a Chinese Canadian. More specifically, I have beenthinking about our society’s shift in attitude towards people who looklike me— from xenophobia in the past (and present), to the currentromanticization of East Asian culture. When the pandemic first began, I encountered tireless casual bigotry. From acts as seemingly innocuous as people deliberately not goingthrough doors I held open for them, to bold insolence like passersbydramatically holding their breath as I walked past, I experienced subtleand not-so-subtle discrimination. I was yelled at to “go home”, butwhere was I supposed to go? This is my home. The sad truth is that I experienced the best of it. Asian Elders facedthe bulk of the anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic— a quickGoogle search for “elderly Asian Canadian hate crime” provides17,700,000 sickening results. Social media was no stranger to the risein hate crimes, either. As any regular Instagram user can attest, onewould open the app to be barraged with infographics, articles, andsurveillance footage of yet another brutal attack against an elderlyAsian person. In reality, East-Asian Canadians have faced discrimination andxenophobia for hundreds of years. For example, the Canadian governmentpassed the Chinese Immigration act in 1885 as a way to restrict Chineseimmigration after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Thisact enforced a $50 head tax on Chinese immigrants, becoming the firstpiece of Canadian legislation that excluded immigrants based on theirethnicity (Gagnon et al. ). The Canadian Pacific Railway itself is afitting example of Canadian discrimination against East Asians— theconstruction of the CPR would not have been possible without the 15,000Chinese labourers who suffered under inhumane working conditions(Lavallé 2008), and yet the federal government did not formallyapologize until 2006 (Chan 2016). Additionally, Asian Canadians continue to encounter a myriad of harmfulstereotypes, including but not limited to the “model minority myth” andthe “Yellow Peril” movement. Firstly, according to Yao (2021), the“model minority myth” is a stereotype that “depicts Asians as hardworking [sic], successful at school and in the workplace, and aseconomically prosperous”. While this may seem like a positive stereotypeat first, the myth “overlooks a history of systemic racism towardsCanadians of Asian descent and trivializes contemporary problems withinAsian Canadian communities” (Yao 2021). Secondly, “Yellow Peril” refersto the social movement that was formed after Asians immigrated toWestern countries and agreed to work for lower wages, which was seen asa threat to society (Tsu 2005). Asians were portrayed as barbaric anduncivilized, which can be compared to COVID-related anti-Asian racism. I am astonished by how quickly our society has shifted from alienatingEast Asian Canadians to overly romanticizing our culture. Just two yearsago, East Asians were ostracized at an all-time peak, and now East Asianculture is glorified and fetishized by our society. At times, it feelslike non-Asians love my culture more than I do. By “love”, I don’t meanself-acceptance or anything of that nature— I mean an intenseidolization of cultural traits for which I was made fun of before. Suddenly, my appearance, which is used to “other” me, now seems to be invogue. For example, the “fox eye” trend, which gained popularity in2020, consists of people applying makeup around their eyes to make themappear elongated and slightly upwards-slanting. This technique is mostcommonly used by people with rounder eyes that are considered“beautiful” by the Eurocentric standards that exist in North America(and, by extension, the world). Why is this okay? My naturallyalmond-shaped eyes subjected me to name-calling in the predominantlywhite elementary school I attended. Now, the same people who pulledtheir eyes back to mock me are wearing makeup to look more like the facethey made me resent. It goes without saying that makeup can be a fantastic outlet forself-expression, but when that expression comes from an oppressormimicking a feature for which the oppressed were shunned for hundreds ofyears, it becomes more complicated. Other examples of our society’s shift to romanticizing East Asiansinclude the hyperfeminine “exotic” trope used to portray East Asianwomen in popular culture, and deifying East Asian media (i. e. K-pop andanime), both of which may be classified as “Yellow Fever”. “YellowFever” is a derogatory colloquial term that refers to white menfetishizing East Asian women, or non-Asians fetishizing East Asians ingeneral (Spolia 2021). One cause of Yellow Fever is the harmfulstereotypes associated with East Asians— for example, being docile andsubservient. This fetishization places East Asians in a position wheresociety objectifies and puts us on some kind of sick pedestal, on thebasis of racial stereotypes. I hope that this article has provided another outlook on our society’sperception of East Asians, and the way it has shifted.

    "title": "Where My Family Came From: How I Understand Ukrainian-Russian Conflict",
    "body": "2022/05/17 - Over the centuries, many countries believed that they had the right torule Ukraine - Lithuania, Poland, and Russia are just a few of the many. Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s belief that Ukraine isn’t a nation is amajor contributor to his unwarranted attack against the Ukrainianpeople. Russia and Ukraine have had a long and complex history, andunderstanding it better provides important context for the war today. Russian injustices against Ukraine didn’t just start last year - they’vebeen happening for a very long time. Growing up, I heard stories of the terrible things that happened inUkraine, but I had never really understood them. Both of my grandparentson my mom’s side were born in Ukraine, and immigrated to Canada whenthey were young. They didn’t live long in the country, but mygreat-grandparents did. From 1922 to 1991, Ukraine was under Russia’sthumb as a part of the Soviet Union. The mass death toll and theoppression that the Ukrainian people suffered influenced their desire toget out. When the Second World War started and borders loosened,Ukrainians fled, choosing to go through active war zones rather thanstay where they weren’t wanted. Among those people were my young baba(grandma) and dido (grandpa). For me, the story of Ukraine came in small pieces of my family’shistory. My great grandmother’s twin sister was a freedom fighter, andwas killed by Soviet enforcers. For the rest of her life, her mothertold her she wished that her brave daughter was the one who livedinstead. My baba’s uncle had the flu and was too sick to go to work oneday, and the next day the secret police took him to a Gulag, one of theSoviet labour camps that housed millions of people during its peak. Hedidn’t get out until the 50s. To say that the Soviet Union wasn’t a goodplace to live would be an understatement. I feel like people today consider Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to be anisolated incident, the random whims of a madman. Ukrainians know thatisn’t true. Russia has consistently believed that Ukraine is not astate. The diminishing of the Ukrainian language and culture wasconstant during Soviet times, and did not end when the Soviet Unionfell. The disrespect that Russia has towards Ukraine was on full displayduring the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when Russian troops just walkedinto the peninsula and took it, saying that it always was part ofRussia. That weekend, my family went to a protest downtown. They spokein all Ukrainian, and I only understood about every other word they weresaying. My clearest memory is the odd sense of foreboding in the air -the knowledge many people seemed to have that something worse was goingto come. For Ukrainians, what happened in February wasn’t out of the blue. It hasbeen a long time coming, because Russia views Ukraine as a subservientprovince that can be brought to heel. In my family today, there’s an oddmix of both sadness and pride. My grandparents worry for their cousinsoverseas, but also show pride in their home country’s resistance. Thelast few weeks have shown that the fight for sovereignty, democracy, andfreedom is a cornerstone of the Ukrainian identity. In the stories of myancestors, I see perseverance in the face of tragedy and hope for abetter future. These are the qualities on display in their home countrytoday. Slava Ukraini (Glory to Ukraine).

    "body": "2022/05/17 - Last week, I was re-watching Doctor Strange in anticipation of the newmovie Mulitiverse of Madness and I came across a character that Inearly forgot. Who is Dr. Christine Palmer? According to Marvel’s “Whatif?”, her death leads to the destruction of a universe. That’s a boldstatement for a character who only showed up on the big screen for 16minutes and 32 seconds. I want to like her as a character. She is an ERdoctor in a superhero world, which is a pretty interesting angle. Christine’s character is played by Rachel McAdams, a great actress. However, by the end of the movie, I felt like Christine was stuck in themirror universe of Doctor Strange. She was there, but she affectednothing. This speaks to a larger issue about non-superhero love interests inMarvel movies. With the exception of Pepper Potts from the Iron Manseries, Marvel has been unable to create a long lasting love interestthat is actually engaging. Captain America had a promising start withPeggy Carter but by the second movie things went off the rails. I knowthat Sharon Carter is a comic book character, but Cap kissing her rightafter visiting her aunt Peggy in the hospital weirdly makes Cap’s lovelife a family affair. One of the ways Marvel could have made characters like Christine feelnecessary and interesting would be to have her represent a theme in thestory. An example of this would be Mary Jane Watson in the Sam RaimiSpider-Man movies. She represents sacrifice, the life Peter Parker couldhave had if he wasn’t Spider-Man. In Doctor Strange, the writers fail tocreate a believable relationship between Stephen Strange and Christine. It never feels like Strange is sacrificing anything in his personal lifewhen he leaves Christine at the end of the movie. Love interests don’t necessarily need to be a part of the main story. Their romances can just be fun distractions to understand and relate tothe characters better. This is exemplified in DC’s Wonder Woman whereSteve and Diana’s relationship alleviates some of the stress from theWW1 scenes and adds depth to both of their characters through theiremotional connection. The main reason why I go back to movies like theX-Men series is the interesting and complicated friendships betweencharacters like Professor X and Magneto. Dr. Strange is more focused onexposition and the larger picture of the mechanics of magic to give thecharacters time to become larger than stereotypical archetypes. My largest problem with Marvel’s supporting characters is that they arethe people who are supposed to keep our heroes feeling human. I think inDr. Strange, this can be excused as it is still a fun movie. Ipersonally am more invested when I understand the character and usuallythat’s achieved through dialogue between characters. Although fights arecool, the moments I remember in movies are dialogue-focused andemotional. If the multiverse has infinite possibilities there has to beone universe with a well written christine palmer. "

    "body": "2022/02/15 - There are a few things that I think are fundamentally part of theCanadian experience. The first is pointing out every single Canadiancelebrity on the radio, in a TV show, or in a basketball game. Thesecond is claiming moral superiority over Americans. We have a lot tobe proud of! We have a 17 percent higher vaccination rate, universalhealthcare, and Tim Hortons. On the whole, Canadians have been great about following the strictlockdown measures that have been in place sporadically since March of 2020. We’ve worn our masks, socially distanced, and left the halls ofMCI for the lonely chaos of virtual school. It’s been a long, exhausting couple of years, but we’ve made it out the other side. Asmall but vocal number of Canadians, though, have decided that they’re completely done with all the public health mandates. A convoy of truckers, calling themselves the “Freedom Convoy”, arrivedin Ottawa on January the 28th, protesting new laws requiringunvaccinated truckers to quarantine once they returned to Canada. It’sworth noting that 90 percent of Canadian truckers are vaccinated, andtheir regulatory body denounced the protest. It quickly grew, and bythe time the convoy arrived in Ottawa, it had gathered fringe,far-right elements. Some people waved confederate flags, carried Trump 2024 signs, anddemanded free food from soup kitchens. Though the majority werepeaceful, they don’t appear to be leaving anytime soon, and theirdemands have snowballed into ending all restrictions. Similar protestsare planned in Toronto, and will have likely occurred by the timeanyone reads this. I don’t think anyone likes the mandates we have to deal with, and Iunderstand the truckers’ frustrations. Lockdowns have hurt theCanadian economy, forcing small businesses to close. They have hurtour mental health, isolating us from our friends and families andcausing increases in depression and anxiety. Many Canadians feelunheard by their government, and want their concerns to be takenseriously. While their motives might be understandable, their actions are causinga great deal of harm. Ironically, Ottawa has been in lockdown becauseof the huge numbers of truckers pouring into the city - on lockdownbecause of the anti-lockdown protest! Demanding an end to allrestrictions also fails to take into account the serious harm thatCovid-19 has caused. Many people have lost loved ones to the virus,and while I was fortunate enough not to do so, two members of myimmediate family are suffering long-term effects from Covid, which hasradically affected their day-to-day lives. We live in a democratic society, so people definitely have the rightto protest. However, it’s clear that the “Freedom Convoy” has gone onlong enough. The truckers haven’t just shut down the city of Ottawa. They’re putting their desire for personal freedom above the collectivehealth of Canadian society, and are showing that right-wing extremismisn’t just an American problem - it’s a Canadian one too.

    "body": "2022/02/15 - “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only inpartnership with Russia”, Russian President, Vladamir Putin wrote inJuly 2021. Putin constructs a narrative where Ukraine is beingcontrolled by the West, and his invasion will lead to the unification oftwo lost destined regions. The Russian President is trying to achieve astrategic purpose by manipulating Ukraine. 100,000 Russian troops areplaced on the border of Ukraine. It is believed that Russia has enoughforces positioned at the moment to invade all of Ukraine. At first,Russia claimed that it was only holding routine military exercises nearUkraine, but then they started setting up field hospitals, whichindicates preparation for war. Cyberattacks from Russia have defaced theUkrainian government’s public websites and they can further manipulatebanking, transportation, and electrical systems. This could wreak havocon the structure of society in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine are historically linked as a group of people calledRus moved to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and then spread out to regionsin modern Russia today. Ukraine was a republic of the former SovietUnion after World War II until it declared its independence in August  Putin has brought this up to justify his actions like in thearticle he wrote on the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians“together we have always been and will be many times stronger and moresuccessful. For we are one people. ” The Soviet Union dissipated into 15republics, but in a post-USSR world, the Russian and Ukrainianeconomies, culture, and politics remain deeply interconnected. In 2014,the Ukrainian people forced their pro-Russian leader into exile andRussia responded with an invasion to maintain Russian influence, notwanting to lose Ukraine to the West. Russia seized power over Ukraine’sthe Crimean Peninsula. Soon after, a civil war broke out in EasternUkraine in the industrial regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, fueled byPutin, who has backed pro-Russian fighters intending to break off achunk of the country. Putin claims that he is defending the rights ofNative Russian speakers in the area. Putin has dreams of bringing Imperial Russia back to life and NATO’sincreasing influence in the east makes it hard to achieve that goal. TheNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was founded in 1949 to protectagainst Soviet aggression. If one nation in NATO is attacked, then allthe third party nations will mobilize their defense. Thirty countriesare a part of NATO, including the former Soviet Republics of Lithuania,Estonia, and Latvia. Russia wants NATO to return to its pre-1997 bordersand calls for NATO to put a stop to its eastward expansion. If NATOcontinues expanding eastward it would increase NATO’s footprint alongRussian borders, making it more vulnerable to an attack. Putin believed the dissolution of the USSR to be “the greatestgeopolitical catastrophe of the century” he said in an interview in  He compares Russia and Ukraine’s relationship to that of Austriaand Germany or the US and Canada, where people from either country cantravel to the other yet still feel at home. He thinks the West is tryingto sell its ideologies to ex-Soviet countries and wants to invite themto join NATO which would ruin the relationship between both countries. Putin has put out a list of demands, which if not met, will be followedby an attack on Ukraine. Russia has demanded that NATO: stop includingnew members, withdraw its troops from Eastern Europe and that Americavow not to protect its allies in Eastern Europe with nuclear weapons. NATO refuses to deny Ukraine or any other country the right to joinNATO. The west is not united in its preferred tactics to handle this situationand all would like to handle the situation differently. This situationis very delicate and we may not see desirable results if variouscountries disagree on how to proceed. There is a very good possibilityPutin meets his goal no matter how the rest of the world responds. IfPutin’s demands are met, he eliminates the threat NATO could have onRussia, and if not, he will move forward with war, and he gets to spreadhis influence further in the east. The people of Ukraine currently standon the brink of war as the world watches world leaders decide theirfate. Stay tuned for the next issue to find out more.

    "title": "Two West Side Stories: Old vs New",
    "body": "2022/02/15 - A spoiler-free comparison of the 1961 and 2021 film adaptations of theclassic Broadway musical West Side Story The musical West Side Story by Arthur Laurents, Leonard Bernstein, andStephen Sondheim has enthralled audiences for generations, whether it beonstage or onscreen. The classic Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo andJuliet finds itself retold in 1960s New York City, amidst a rivalrybetween the Jets and the Sharks; two gangs of White and Puerto Ricanteenagers, respectively. One night at a school dance, two teenagers fromthese opposing sides, Tony and Maria, meet and fall in love. Thisprovokes even more animosity between the two gangs, setting off a chainreaction of tragic events. This review will first compare certainaspects of the 1961 and 2021 versions of the film, then go in-depth onparticular characters. West Side Story holds a special place in the hearts of BIPOC musicaltheatre fans. Musical numbers such as America highlight the past andongoing injustices against people of colour and immigrants. Many reviewshave labelled the original West Side Story as a “diverse” franchise,and although this is, in part, true, the original Broadway and filmproductions of the musical faced controversy for having white actorsplay Puerto Rican characters while wearing brownface. The film alsofaced criticism from Latinx audiences, who called out the stereotypicalportrayal of Puerto Rican characters and the overall lack ofrepresentation. The 2021 remake, however, features a cast with Latinxactors playing Latinx roles, something sadly unimaginable in the era of1960s film. While it is certainly wonderful that the casting in the 2021remake of West Side Story wasn’t blatantly racist, there is still muchprogress to be made in terms of BIPOC representation in media. WestSide Story is just the beginning of a renaissance of culturalrepresentation. The choreography in West Side Story has always been legendary. Five-time Tony winner Jerome Robbins choreographed both the Broadway andfilm versions of the play, illuminating the stage and screen withgraceful ballet and characteristics of flamenco. Justin Peck, thechoreographer of West Side Story (2021), is also a Tony award-winningchoreographer, and fills the shoes of Robbins flawlessly. Both versionsof the film execute the school dance scene extremely well, but inparticular, the directing in the 2021 version makes it feel as if theactors are dancing out from the screen. The choreography in the 2021remake of West Side Story seems more energetic than its older version,but the sixty-year gap in film technology is probably to blame here, asthe camera shots were more limited and stagnant in the 1961 film. A character often overlooked in West Side Story is Anybodys, a wannabeJet member. Anybodys was portrayed as a tomboyish girl in the originalfilm and Broadway versions of West Side Story. Yet, the new remake isthe first major production to depict Anybodys as a transmasculinenonbinary character, played by Iris Menas. Anybodys tries to join theJets but is constantly rejected. Eventually, Anybodys plays spy for theJets on an important task (no spoilers) and is welcomed into the gang bya Jet member, Action, who says, “You done good, buddy boy,”, essentiallyaffirming Anybodys as one of them. Last but not least, it is imperative to discuss Rita Moreno’sreappearance in the franchise. Rita Moreno is a Puerto Rican-Americanactress who became the first Latina to achieve EGOT status (artists whohave won at least one Emmy Award, Grammy Award, Oscar Award, and TonyAward) in 1977. Moreno originated the role of Anita in West Side Storyon Broadway, and later in the 1961 film, for which she won an Oscar anda Golden Globe. In the 2021 remake of West Side Story, Moreno playsValentina, the owner of Doc’s Drug Store. Valentina takes over the roleof Doc in the previous film adaptation, running the pharmacy and givingTony a place to stay. In the new film, Valentina is the widow of Doc,and their love story parallels that of Tony and Maria, the protagonistsof the film— A white man and a Puerto Rican woman fall in love, in aculture where it is unseemly. Perhaps one of the most breathtaking performances in the film isSomewhere, sung by Rita Moreno. Somewhere is a song about one dayfinding an accepting society to live in, and it was initially a duetbetween Tony and Maria in the original Broadway and film versions ofWest Side Story. The remake, however, features Somewhere as a soloby Valentina. This change gives the song a whole new meaning, with thelyrics referring to Valentina’s past with Doc, instead of referring toTony and Maria’s possible future. Moreno delivers a poignant andlachrymose performance, with stunning live singing (she was even sick atthe time!) To conclude, both versions of West Side Story are phenomenalmasterpieces that will go down in musical theatre history. While theyhave their differences, the one thing they have in common is stunningchoreography, and the extraordinary talent of Rita Moreno. In myopinion, the original film cannot be beat, but both adaptations of WestSide Story are truly breathtaking films, and a great place to start ifyou want to become acquainted with musical theatre Image source: https://wordpress. org/openverse/image/998bc99b-7229-4eec-8726-2fce13629f9a/ "

However,despite many valiant attempts to embrace the genre, I have never beenable to gain an appreciation for it. Personally, I find most dystopianmedia far too cynical and demoralizing to read or watch. It always seemsto center around a) two teenager’s sucking face in a world where theyare divided based on which basic stereotype they fit into, and b) randomobjects like pencils are illegal for some reason. My feud with dystopiahas now reached a boiling point. The extreme amount of negativity isgetting exhausting and during a pandemic the idea of dystopia iscurrently getting a bit too close for comfort. When times get tough, Iwant to flock to the hopeful naive optimistic shores of Utopia, and morespecifically Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). TNG is set in the 24th century, and follows the alien and human crewof the U. S. S. Enterprise. Led by Captain Picard, the crew embarks onadventures and misadventures while exploring the final frontier ofspace. The TNG world feels real, minus the amazing retro futuristic70s fashion (I mean just look at Wesley Crusher’s sweaters). Theuniverse of Star Trek is like a warm cup of chocolate after a hard day;comforting and familiar. It makes a point to illustrate a relatableworld and show humanity at its finest. The characters still have pettyconflicts and aren’t paragons of virtue, but like us, they improve andkeep improving. Although almost every episode has photon torpedoes ready to be released,there is a focus on diplomacy and finding non-violent ways to endconflict. TNG approaches most issues with maturity and a bit of humor,especially when dealing with Q (Star Trek’s version of a Trickster God). A great example of this is the Season 3 episode, “the Enemy”, where LtCmdr. Geordi La Forge is trapped on a deadly planet with a Romulanofficer. Although the governments represented by these characters havebeen in conflict for years, Geordi and the officer are forced to find away to work together to survive. As the crew boldly goes where no onehas gone before, they remind us that, despite all odds, we survive. Weevolve and we have the potential to change our future. I think right nowthat is the message we need. The world needs less Katnisses and moreCaptain Picards. Image taken by Aidan Schreder "

    "title": "Tearing Down Booster Myths In-Time for Your 18th Birthday",
    "body": "2022/02/15 - Nowadays, rumours and word-of-mouth are primary ways of gettinginformation. While sometimes this can be beneficial in spreadingimportant details, in our current world, where news is heavily basedaround science and medicine, second-hand information tends to beinaccurate. These instances of misinformation can be hard to spot, ascountless news outlets and media professionals spread false facts likewildfire, taking advantage of the fact that many people will believewhat they hear. As we move further into 2022, this will have an evenlarger impact on the actions taken in regards to individual health. This year, many of MCI’s senior students will hit the big milestone ofturning 18. This new-found adulthood comes with many perks: being ableto sign yourself out of school, get a credit card, and, according to theprovince of Ontario, get a booster shot. While this is so exciting, it’simportant to remember that, as we’ve established, there are manydiscrepancies between the information spread about the COVID-19 vaccinesand what is actually true. I want to break down some common myths andfalsehoods about the vaccine booster shot. Whether you are eligible forthe booster or not, everyone should have all the facts to help them makean informed decision about their own health and well-being. MYTH: Pfizer is the better vaccine compared to Moderna. TRUTH: In Canada, two different vaccines are approved as boostershots: Pfizer and Moderna. Many people have the belief that Moderna isthe lesser vaccine compared to Pfizer, with adults turning down theModerna shot. According to a study published in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association (JAMA), Moderna’s vaccine actually providesslightly better protection compared to Pfizer. With the Delta variant,adults who received two doses of Moderna had a lower risk ofhospitalization than those who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTechvaccine. While Pfizer is the only approved vaccine booster for Ontariansages 18-29, it is worth noting that for adults ages 30-70, Moderna isquite possibly the best choice to help combat COVID-19 at this time. MYTH: Mixing different vaccines is dangerous and it’s better tostick with just one. TRUTH: In July 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) warnedagainst mixing vaccines, making it seem as if this was a big no-no goingforward. Yet as new advancements are made every day, it has been shownthat mixing vaccines is perfectly safe. The provinces of Quebec,Ontario, and British Columbia have all confirmed the benefits of gettingdiffering vaccines. In January of this year, Dr. Brian Conway of theVancouver Infectious Disease Centre stated that mixing Pfizer andModerna vaccines “show the immune system the virus in two slightlydifferent ways that may lead to a better, stronger, and longer termprotection against the virus. ” He urges people not to “vaccine shop”,and instead, focus on booking a booster appointment as soon as youbecome eligible. MYTH: Everyone is expected to get Omicron anyways, so there’s nopoint in getting boosted. TRUTH: If you have already received two doses, you may believe thatthis is enough to protect yourself from COVID-19. You also might thinkthat, since it is predicted that the majority of people will get theOmicron variant, it is pointless to aim to protect yourself at all bygetting boosted. Unfortunately, none of these statements are true. Studies show that a person’s protection against COVID-19 reduces overtime - explained through the term “waning immunity”. The risk offully-vaccinated people (those with two doses) getting COVID-19, andespecially the Omicron variant, increases as time goes on. The levels ofone’s antibodies get lower after 3-9 months, meaning that the longer onegoes unprotected, it is harder for the body to fight off infections orviruses. Boosters replenish your antibodies, bringing them back tohigher levels and reducing the risk of getting the virus. Generally, ourbody’s immune system is much more effective with more triggers, and cancontinue to fight off viruses if we give it the tools to do so. It’s easy to believe things that are frequently and convincingly statedin public or in the media. Being misinformed can be scary, as you don’thave control over the choices you make when it comes to protectingyourself. With some of the largest booster myths debunked, hopefully youcan use your knowledge to educate yourself and others, and feel moreconfident in your decisions to protect yourself against COVID-19.

    "body": "2022/02/15 - It is natural to feel anxiety during the times we live in. The COVID-19pandemic has taken a mental toll on students and teachers alike. We havehad to go through constantly changing circumstances, which has causedmany people to struggle with their mental health. In times of greatstress, we all need some time to slow down and unwind. Here are threegreat ways to help yourself and those around you manage the pressure.  Develop a Healthy RoutineA crucial part of mental health is to develop healthy habits. It’salways important to take care of yourself, and there are many ways tostart. You can try to eat healthy and well balanced meals, as well asexercise regularly. Also, remember to get at least 8 hours of sleep. These small, yet intentional changes can boost self esteem and actuallymake you feel good about yourself. If you get used to these routines, itcan boost your self image and improve your mental wellbeing.  Take a Break from the NewsIt’s normal to want to know all the facts by looking at the news, but atthe same time, it’s also important to take a break from hearing aboutthe pandemic. Doing activities that you enjoy, such as going on walks,creating artwork, or watching TV, can boost your mental health greatly.  Talk with Friends and FamilyThirdly, connecting with your friends and family is very importantduring times of social isolation. You can have phone or video calls,virtual game nights, or text one another. Getting in touch with othersand, either talking about your feelings or choosing to take your mindoff of them, will certainly make you feel less lonely. These things canhelp you feel more connected to the fact that we are all braving throughthe pandemic together. With the pandemic having caused unfamiliar situations, like virtualschool, lockdowns, and limited social gatherings, we are no doubt livingin stressful times. The ever-changing circumstances and responsibilitiesin life can also make it hard to adapt, and certainly don’t make it anyeasier. However, if we remember to take care of ourselves through thingslike healthy lifestyle habits or connecting with loved ones, then we cancertainly start to improve our mental health, and work towards takingour lives back.

    "body": "2022/02/15 - Valentine’s day is typically known as the day of love, romance andspending your entire paycheck on getting your significant other a gift. However, there are many people who don’t really have someone to spendthat time with. Of course, that can make anyone feel really lonely, andlike they are missing out on the best parts of the day. With this list,you could learn to enjoy Valentine’s day all on your own! DON’T FEEL OBLIGATED TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP What’s important to know is that you are not obligated to celebrateValentine’s day. Don’t let the stories that people tell you, or thethings that people say on social media make you feel bad for not beingin a relationship. It can be hard to forget about it, especially sinceevery post on social media, and every commercial on TV will alwaysremind you of Valentine’s day, but there is no rule written in stonemaking you celebrate this day. Don’t feel down because you may not be ina relationship. You are your own person, and no matter what everyoneelse says, you don’t need to feel ashamed for not being in arelationship. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF You can still view Valentine’s day as a day to treat yourself well. Makeit a day to eat your favorite foods, maybe relax and engage in yourfavorite hobbies. Enjoy yourself the best that you can. AVOID CERTAIN TRIGGERS If you feel lonely on Valentine’s day, then distracting yourself may bea good option. Watching romance movies can make you feel lonely. A goodway to prevent this is to try a different genre of songs, movies andother media that could make you feel less alone. MAKE OTHER PLANS You can plan a day that doesn’t revolve around Valentine’s day. You cantake a hike somewhere, or play your favorite video game. You can order ameal from your favorite restaurant. Having different plans can take yourmind off of Valentine’s day, and can give you something else to rememberother than the holiday itself. YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY Valentine’s day can be a wonderful day if you are in a relationship, butit can be much more difficult if you are alone. It’s easy to feel lonelyon this day, and it’s very hard to get over that feeling of not havingsomeone to spend that day with. However, it is still possible to spendit doing what makes you happy.

    "title": "A Valentine to Romantic Comedies: A Love Story in 6 Acts",
    "body": "2022/02/15 - It’s hard to tell when mankind first met the romantic comedy or as thekids these days like to call them “rom-coms”. From William Shakespeare”sThe Taming of the Shrew to 1924 with the release of “Sherlock Jr. and“Girl Shy, audiences have proven that they have a lust for love. At thispoint more people have seen “Wedding Crashers” than have actuallycrashed a wedding (which is a shame, I mean what about that free food?) Over the years the rom-com genre has morphed itself to fit the needs anddesires of the era. In the 1940’s, looking for an escape from the drearywar-time conditions, studios released screwball comedies like “His GirlFriday”. 1950’s filmmakers frustrated by the morally-conservative HayesCode produced innuendo-laden comedies like “The Seven Year Itch”(basically anything starring Marilyn Monroe). The 1970’s brought “Haroldand Maude” and other transgressive films which showed relationships thatwere more introspective. In the “unsupervised age” of the 1980’s whenmore teenagers started going to movies, rom-coms shifted to be moreyouth-focused with films like “Pretty in Pink”. The 1990s - 2000s is mypersonal favorite era of rom-coms producing many classics like “10things I Hate About You”. Sadly in the early 2010s, rom-coms faced adownturn. While there was the occasional studio-backed hit like “La LaLand” they were few and far between. Today the rom-com genre isrecovering and finding new homes in independent film. The Meet Cute I’m personally a huge fan of rom-coms, However, my personal relationshipwith rom coms started out rocky to say the least. They didn’t exactly“Have me at Hello”(Jerry Maguire) Despite my current 5 year rom-comobsession. I originally believed that they were formulaic and horriblyvapid. It took one very special movie; Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World forme to begin to fall in love with the genre. Scott Pilgrim Vs. the Worldis the perfect gateway rom-com. It is a rom-com disguised as aManga-inspired action movie that is filmed and set in Toronto. Falling in Love Montage After Scott Pilgrim, I decided to see if Scott Pilgrim was the“exception and not the rule” (“He’s Just Not That Into You”). As Icontinued on galavanting though rom-com land I slowly stopped watchingthese movies ironically. What I truly admire about these movies is thatthey are truly and honestly themselves and they don’t masquerade as moredramatic or serious movies. They know they are guilty pleasures and theyserve that purpose excellently. Out of this category I found a mountainof movies that I have watched more times than I care to admit. Onerecommendation I have is “27 Dresses” in which Jane” always thebridesmaid but never the bride” has the difficult task of being the maidof honor for her sister who is marrying the man of her dreams. Big Dramatic Fight While galavanting through rom-com land I became acutely aware that a lotof the movies that I really liked had terrible critic scores. A constantcriticism of rom-coms is that despite having women as their targetaudience, they perpetuate sexist regressive tropes. There are manyexamples of this from women not being able to maintain positivefriendships with each other to women having to “fix men” and being putinto essentially abusive relationships. The most prevalent and worryingconcern is that people will get a tainted corrupted view of romancethough rom-coms. In rom coms, there are many many amoral tropes passedoff as “romantic”. For example, stalking someone or interrupting awedding with a proclamation of love. In rom coms these actions arerewarded with romance and affirmations. However, if you were to attemptthis in the real world with someone you were romantically interested inyour actions would instead be met with horror and probably a restrainingorder. Redemptive Arc While I acknowledge these concerns, I feel if you judge every genre byits worst movies you won’t be able to watch anything. I would argue thatmost rom-coms are inherently femmist. As the Canadian Screen Awardwinning web series People Watching states “the first rule of feminismclub is that there is no singular definition”. Rom coms have not onlybeen pioneered by women like Nancy Meyers and Nora Efron but the genrehas been inherently feminist from its conception. A great example ofthis is Pride and Prejudice’s Elizabeth Bennet denying Mr. Darcy’s firstproposal because despite his status and her family’s pressure for her tomarry, he disrespects her and her family. The argument that people who watch rom coms will make them their “roadmaps” on their way to romance doesn’t make sense as it doubts theintelligence of viewers and their ability to tell the difference betweenfantasy and reality. Rom-coms like the characters within them arecapable of positive development. In fact they’re extremelyself-critical. The genre is filled with deconstructions of harmfultropes to remind the genre and its creators of present issues and remindthem to fix themselves. A particularly great example of rom-comchallenging the genre is the CW series Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. In thisshow, the main character Rebecca Bunch works as a high-paid lawyer inNew York and is completely miserable. Inspired by a chance meeting withher first boyfriend Josh Chan she moves to West Covina California tofollow him. The show from that description sounds like every careerwoman finds love and second chances in a small town Hallmark movie. However crazy-ex takes a look back at these tropes and applies real worklogic and consequences to them (albeit in a setting where characterswill occasionally burst into song). What comes after is a heartfelt lookat mental illness and the journey to self love. Running to the Airport/Sailing away in a Boat Honestly, I am personally conflicted with the term “guilty pleasure”because I feel that people should be proud of what they watch no matterwhat other people think. You should be proud of watching movies nomatter if it’s a spoof movie from the 2000s, a Zombie B movie (I don’tknow why zombies get so much hate) or even dare I say it Adam Sandlercomedies. To me, romantic comedies are perfectly represented by the“running to the airport scenes” that end many of these films. The bigspeeches are always kind of embarrassing and would never work in reallife but, they also are endearing and hilarious. Image taken by Mira Seth "

    "title": "DUNE: OSCAR-WORTHY OR OVERHYPED?",
    "body": "2021/11/30 - We’ve all heard about Dune, the box office hit that packed theatreswhen it came out in October 2021. It marked a return to cinema, bothliterally and metaphorically. For months in advance, it was advertisedthrough billboards, movie previews, and Timothee Chalamet’s Instagram. But after the whole 2 hours and 35 minutes were over, was it all it wascracked up to be? Dune was a big deal before it was even finished, with good reason. When Frank Hubert’s novel Dune – which the film is based on – waspublished in 1965, it became an instant classic of science fiction. Itapproached the genre with humanity, depicting a distant future wherehumans still grappled with the relationship between religion andpolitics, the ethics of monarchy, and the way physical land shapescultures and their people. All that in only 800 pages. Dune was a landmark novel beloved by an entire generation of sci-fireaders. That made it perfect for a film adaptation by the renownedmaster of the absurd, David Lynch, in 1984. The improving specialeffects of the time helped, and the film’s art design is praised to thisday. But the performances of the film’s actors (namely, Sting - yes, themusician) and the feel of a 10-hour film packed into 2 hours, thanks toLynch’s 4-hour cut being vetoed, resulted in a mess of a movie that lostmillions of dollars at the box office. Today, Lynch still considers thefilm one of his greatest failures. For 34 years, no one else made a real attempt at Dune. So when DenisVillenueve announced that he was slated to direct a new version in 2018– fresh off of critically-acclaimed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049– hopes were high. He even announced the initial decision to make thefilm in two parts, ensuring fans wouldn’t have to deal with anotherLynch-like result. The revelations that stars like Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya had signedon only added more fuel to the already huge Dune fire. It seemed thata pop culture obsession and cinematic masterpiece might combine tocreate one massive, unstoppable blockbuster. Even the pandemic delayingDune’s release date from December 2020 to October 2021 didn’t bust itsflow; it created a kind of long-haul buzz, like getting enthusiasticabout your birthday a month in advance. It created hype. The novelty of Hubert’s book and the failure of Lynch’s film attempthelped make Dune so anticipated. If Lynch couldn’t do it, who could?It made Villenueve’s attempt feel all the more risky. Jason Momoa, OscarIsaac and Rebecca Ferguson were added to the cast, and forget subtlety– if the film tanked, the world would know. When Dune came out, audiences were prepared to be wowed. And so theywere. The cinematography, the score, the performances, the productiondesign, and the costume design (among other things) had praise pouringin left and right. Not to mention that Dune dominated the box officeon its opening weekend with a smashing $47 million. It was official-Dune had been received and loved, and the hype was worth it. Or was it? When I saw Dune opening weekend, I thought it was beautiful. Thecinematography was larger than life; the performances were applaudable;the score was – in traditional Hans Zimmer fashion – transporting. Inall respects, it was a beautiful film. But was it everything I’d expected of it? Was it phenomenal, best-evergreat, like the level of hype around it’s release had promised? Thesimple answer is no. For a film so advertised and talked about, I’d expected genuineperfection, or close to it. I wasn’t expecting a flat portrayal of theplot, only 7 minutes of Zendaya, or an unfinished ending that teased asequel without ever providing a full story arc. I was disappointed. Thefilm had been advertised and word-of-mouthed as a masterpiece, and itsimply wasn’t. If I hadn’t known that Dune was as anticipated as it was, I would’vethought it was better. I would’ve been pleasantly surprised by thecinematography and performances, casually unimpressed by the lineralnessof the plot, but pleased nonetheless. But knowing the film had alreadybeen established as a Big Deal™ almost made me search for flaws to pointout. For example, there were a few too many thousand-yard stares, shotsof sand blowing in the wind, and blank, angry faces for my liking. Thoseshots looked tacky and suggestive of more depth than they actuallypossessed. If I hadn’t known of Dune’s preconceived excitement, Imight’ve been less critical and thought those shots were emotionallycontemplative. It seemed to me that Dune’s quiet downfall was its hype. It builtunattainable expectations for the film. It also seemed like no one wasready to admit the film’s flaws, not after such an extensive wait. It’slike it would be almost personally demoralizing to quash one’s ownexcitement with critiques. So when I see raving reviews about Dune, I think twice about theirvalidity. Do people think the film’s great because it’s really great, orbecause they expected it to be, or because it seems like everyone elselikes it? It raises the question of whether wide anticipation andadvertising damage the art of a film and the truth of its merit. At whatpoint does a film stop being a film and become a blockbuster? I won’t go as far to say that Dune was bad, because it wasn’t. It wasin many ways a marvel of set design, cinematography, and performance. But that doesn’t mean that it was great. Of course, it’s still going to win an Oscar. Image taken by Aidan Schreder "

    "body": "2021/11/26 - If you haven’t been living under a rock since 2008, you’ve probablyheard of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You know, that massive franchiseof interconnected superhero blockbusters filled with one-liners,(mostly) forgettable villains, and a big-budget third act beatdown. Ipersonally love Marvel movies, flaws and all, and most people tend toagree. Out of 26 films, not one has gotten overwhelmingly bad reviews -at least, until the Eternals. Eternals came out this November, witha 47 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and negative reviews accusing it ofbeing uninspiring and confusing. I have a bit of a controversial opinion - I loved the Eternals. Itfocuses on a group of immortal beings, sent to earth 7000 years ago toprotect the population from the monstrous Deviants. Centuries ago, theydefeated the deviants and went their separate ways, but when a deviantcomes to London in 2026, the team must reunite to save the world. Mostof the film follows Sersi, one of the Eternals, who attempts to find theothers and stop the upcoming emergence (your standard Marvel movie endof the world fare). This takes a while - there are ten Eternals whorejoin the team one by one - but Sersi’s journey takes her all acrossthe world. The flamboyant Kingo has become a Bollywood star, and hisinteractions with his valet provide a lot of the humor in the movie. Druig, an immortal burdened with the power of controlling human minds,has shut himself away in an isolationist community. All of the settingsare so different and the characters introduced are compelling enoughthat it doesn’t feel like a drag. The movie really shines when it explores the characters and theirinteractions with each other throughout history. They’ve been aroundbasically forever, and had their hand in shaping history. Thena is knownto the Greeks as their goddess of war Athena. The tech genius Phastoscreated much of human technology. Sersi’s creations are prized ashistorical artifacts. The Eternals build a family through the ages, andthe character dynamics are really fun to see. There are romanticrelationships (such as Sersi and Ikaris) and platonic ones (likeGilgamash and Thena’s deep bond). Although the movie has a large numberof new characters to introduce, the flashbacks and time spent fleshingout each character helps give all of them a recognizable personality. Eternals is the most diverse Marvel film by far, not only with regardsto ethnicity, but also disability and sexuality. The super-speedingMakkari is the first deaf superhero, and is played by a woman of colour. Thena suffers from a form of mental illness the movie calls Mahd Wy’ry,and neither her struggles or heroism take a backseat during her journey. Finally, the genius eternal Phastos is the first superhero to openly bedepicted as gay in a Marvel movie, an important and long overdue attemptat inclusion. I won’t deny that the Eternals has flaws. It tries to introduce toomany characters and span too many centuries at once, and ends up feelinga little overstuffed. Nonetheless, it has heart, compelling characterrelationships, and a desire to show an accurate and diverserepresentation of what a superhero should be. This movie is well worththe watch!

    "body": "2021/11/25 - In the summer of 1901, two English women walking the grounds of thePalace of Versailles noticed small distortions in their reality, such asthe wind not blowing in the trees, a lack of light and shade effect, andthe world taking on a lifeless and flat appearance. Charlotte AnneMoberly and Eleanor Jourdain are recorded as the first people toexperience a timeslip during their visit to Paris in the summer of 1901. They wrote a book, called An Adventure, in 1911 to describe theirexperience. Timeslips are a paranormal phenomenon where people go about their dayand are temporarily transported into either the past or future. However,they typically remain in the same location through supernatural meansinstead of technological means. According to their book, as Moberly and Jourdain continued the“unnatural” appearance of their surroundings started to fade away. Theyencountered a man they found “repulsive” with “rough skin” and a youngwoman, wearing outdated clothing, who was sketching on the grass. One ofthe women felt the need to turn away from the sketching woman as herpresence made the woman feel incredibly annoyed. They were directed toan entrance hall by a jaunty man, where they witnessed a wedding party. From there, the women decided to take a carriage back to Jourdain’sapartment. They found this experience strange so they decided to returnto the Palace of Versailles on a later date. Upon their return, thewomen realized that many landmarks they had encountered during theirinitial visit were no longer there and noticed large numbers of peoplecrowding the areas of the palace that had been empty the day of theirinitial visit. They found this odd, as they had gone during the day andspent hours in the Palace without encountering people other than theaforementioned characters. They made inquiries, checking if the palacehad been booked on the day of their initial visit, but there were noprivate bookings that day. They realized later that the people theyencountered resembled members of Marie Antoinette’s court. The man withthe “rough skin” was the 18th-century French nobleman, Comte deVaudreuil. The woman on the grass is believed to have been MarieAntoniette herself, on the same day she learned of the mob that stormedthe Palace of Tuileries. How these women “slipped” into the start of theFrench Revolution remains unclear. There are a multitude of explanations for the phenomenon Moberly andJourdain, and thousands more experienced. Some are rooted in theparanormal, ranging from alien intervention to those who experience saidphenomena being born with supernatural “gifts”. Other explanations pointtowards hysteria, severe mental illness, or some kind of psychologicaldisturbance that altered one’s perception of their present reality. Different arguments conclude that cunning individuals are putting up afacade for public attention. The most plausible explanation seems to bea mixture of hoaxes and possible psychological and mental ailments. Avariety of different and seemingly harmless factors can contribute todisturbances in the nervous system, which may send mixed signals to thebrain which could alter one’s perception of reality. Timeslips make usthink if our conscience can be trusted to be honest at all times. Image source: https://pixels. com/featured/1-palace-of-versailles-pixabay. html/ "

    "title": "Breaking Down the New Spiderman Movie Trailer",
    "body": "2021/11/24 - The Spiderman: No Way Home trailer has made Marvel fans go crazy. Here’s some of what we know about the movie so far. If you haven’t seen the previous Spiderman movies yet, then you may notwant to read this article because there are a lot of spoilers. The newmovie is part of phase four, and has been talked about for what feelslike forever. There are multiple fan theories and many things to coverin the trailer. The opening shot of the official trailer shows Peter Parker (TomHolland) in the rain, beaten up. His expression implies that he is inmourning. A lot of fans are wondering whether someone close to Peter hasdied, or if he is emotional for a different reason. Perhaps one of myfavourite theories about this movie so far is that at the end of thefilm, Peter will have to sacrifice himself to the multiverse to save theones he loves, and he’ll have no way home. Later, the trailer shows the aftermath of the last movie, “Spiderman:Far From Home”, when Peter was exposed as Spiderman. There aresimilarities between outfits worn in the last film and in the trailer,so it’s plausible that this movie starts up right where we left off. Peter’s identity being exposed has obviously ruined his world. Naturally, he goes to someone he knows can help, Doctor Strange. We seeStrange perform some sort of spell that is meant to erase the world’smemory of Peter being Spiderman. If you watch closely, there are fourgold bands surrounding Strange and Peter, which could signify the fouruniverses that are colliding together; the Web universe, the MCU, theRaimi universe and the Venom universe. This is when things get reallyinteresting, though. Strange tells Peter that “visitors” came from different universes withthe spell and then we see just exactly who he was talking about. Thecharacters include Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina),Electro (Jaimie Fox), The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and Sandman (Thomas HadenChurch). All of these villains have been introduced in past Spidermanuniverses, and are now showing up in this one. There is a lot of action in this trailer, and also a great scene betweenDoc Ock and Spiderman. A lot of fans have speculated that Doc Ock isable to absorb Peter’s nanotech suit and use it to his advantage,because there are times where Peter has parts of his suit missing. Thisisn’t the only time Peter has to worry about suit problems, though. Somepeople think there is a whole different suit for when he goes up againstElectro. Confrontation between Peter and Doctor Strange is frequent in thistrailer, and will most likely be constant in the movie. Strange toldPeter it was the fate of the various villains to die at the hands ofSpiderman, but Peter seems to be conflicted about that. When Peter talksto Aunt May, he tells her that he can’t save everyone. Does he mean hecan’t save his universe as well as these villains from their own fate? Near the end of the trailer we get a glimpse of MJ (Zendaya), and itseems she is falling to her death, but Spiderman is there reaching outto save her. This is a parallel to Andrew Garfeild’s Spiderman movie,where he watches Gwen Stacey fall to her own death. This is a majorreason why so many people assume Tobey Macguire and Andrew Garfield aregoing to have cameos in this movie, which is any Marvel fan’s dream. Unfortunately, it has not yet been officially confirmed. Are you excited for No Way Home now that you’ve heard so manybreakdowns and theories? I’ll definitely be watching this movie the dayit comes out and it already looks like one of Marvel’s most memorablemovies yet.

Haveyou ever been glared at by a goose standing on top of the school, andfeared for your life? But, most importantly… Have you ever wondered what the MCI geese do over winter break? Well, wonder no more! The Beacon is here with your inside scoop on thewinter migration patterns of Canada Geese. Some North American Canada Geese migrate south for the winter season,landing in southern agricultural areas in the United States. Our MCIgeese, however, live in what is known as a year-round range, meaningthey don’t have to migrate to stay warm in the winter. If you havenoticed a particular goosey presence even as the weather has gottencolder, that’s why! We spoke to Nameless Goose #57, who will be referred to as Geraldine,about her experience spending her holiday season right here at MCI. “HONK!” Geraldine exclaimed, before flapping her wings aggressively andscuttling away. My knowledge of the Canadian dialect of Goose is not enough tounderstand what Geraldine so belligerently honked, but she and her goosefriends seem to like it here, so we can interpret that honk as a happyone. Many Canada Geese enjoy grazing on flat stretches of grass , notunlike the fields and lawns of MCI, where they can eat things likeleaves and roots. Since the plants eaten by our feathered friends arenot very nutritious, they can spend around 12 hours per day eating,which is why you might notice Canada Geese (and their droppings) on thefield and lawns quite frequently. In conclusion, some Canada Geese migrate south for the winter, but oursare likely to stay right at home! A very Merry Geesemas and a Honky New Year from all the geese at MCI!

    "title": "It’s Not Over Until Princess Leia Sings (A Breakdown of the Star Wars Christmas Special)",
    "body": "2021/11/23 - Setting the Scene It’s November 17, 1978, and “The Carol Burnett Show” is in its lastseason. “Superman: The Movie” is about to be released and Jimmy Carteris president of the United States. Around 13 million households tune into CBS to watch the first official spin-off of a little indie filmcalled “Star Wars”. Unfortunately, for them this TV special wasincoherent, strange and off-putting. It was truly a test of people’sdesire to see new Star Wars content. Many households may have turned offthe special after the 10 minutes of Wookie conversations withoutsubtitles or the alien Julia Child parody. Others may have toughed itout until the 13 minute bar scene with beloved “Golden Girls” actressBea Arthur playing a bartender who is sexually harassed by a customer. The real masochists will stay to the end only to realize that GeorgeLucas, the creator of Star Wars does not even have his name in thecredits. After Its original airing, it was never shown again. GeorgeLucas tried to destroy every copy of the special show. Carrie Fisher(Princess Leia) preserved one official copy and allegedly would play itin order to to get guests out of her house at Christmas. The realquestion is, who played the role of Jar Jar Binks and let this nightmarehappen? Did this project start out on the Dark Side? Or did it startwith good intentions and get seduced by dark forces like AnakinSkywalker? Production Problems The Star Wars Christmas Special was created with the intent of keepingpeople interested in Star Wars during the time between “A New Hope’’and “The Empire Strikes Back” movie releases. According to co-writerLeonard Ripps, George Lucas had over a dozen ideas including a scrappedone where Han Solo was married to a Wookie. However, the world wasn’tready for something so horrifying, so he settled for a story aboutChewbacca’s family during the celebration of Life Day. Lucas had a clearplot and idea for the writers to flesh out, but he would not be directlyinvolved due to prior obligations working on “The Empire StrikesBack”. Without Lucas, there was no one providing an overall vision toguide the project. Leonard Ripps and Pat Profit were the head writer’son the special and had a background in writing comedy on both “The DickVan Dyke Show” and “The Carol Burnett Show”. As the writers leaned inon their comedic backgrounds and producers pushed to make it a varietyshow, the project veered away from Lucas’ original idea. Casting Chaos Why did the main cast of “Star Wars” agree to do this? Getting theactors to appear in the Christmas special was a struggle. Harrison Ford(Han Solo) just didn’t want to be there. Throughout the entire specialhe clearly looks miserable. When asked in an interview if he had everwatched the special he said, with the cadence of a man who had been in awar: “I lived it ‘’. Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) had a car accidentafter the filming of “A New Hope” which changed his facial features. The Star Wars Christmas Special’s solution to this issue was to applyan obscene amount of foundation to his face leaving him looking like amannequin who was painted to look like Luke Skywalker, or one of thezombies from “In the Flesh” (props to the 10 people reading this whogot that reference). Carrie Fisher fought for one of the better parts ofthe special, a performance of the Life Day song which was set to themusic of the Star Wars theme. The rest of the production was a bit of amess. The actors wearing the Wookie costumes could only wear them for 45minutes before becoming overheated. On top of this, the production ranout of money and had to settle for a weirdly cult-like ending sequencewhere all the Wookies wear red cloaks and carry candles in a bizarreLife Day ritual. This ritual was originally explained but this was cutout of the special because executives felt that a holographicnightmarish Cirque du Soleil-like scene was more important. The onlycreative casting decision in this entire debacle was a short animatedfeature that marks the first appearance of Boba Fett. Post-Credits Although the Star Wars Christmas Special was a deep source of shamefor the cast and crew it has become a cultural touchstone. Personally, Ithink the joy is in watching the commitment to the bit. In this currentclimate of stringent adherence to canon and a fanatic corporate need toconform to the Star Wars brand, it’s comforting that a piece of truechaos is still floating around and is free for anyone to watch onYouTube. In the immortal words of a YouTube commenter, “Disney won’ttake this video down because then they would have to claim ownershipover it. ” So as the holidays draw near, and if you have 97 minutes tospare, do yourself a favour and watch “Die Hard” instead.

    "title": "Not-So-Scary Halloween Movies",
    "body": "2021/10/30 - Halloween is a celebration of everything that is frightening. Fromghosts to gargoyles to going to a party where you don’t know anybody,Halloween preys on everybody’s fears. Many people turn to moviemarathons to fully honour this spooky holiday. Horror classics likeNight of the Living Dead and Scream are usually mainstays. But whatabout the people who are in it for the treats and not the tricks? Thereis no reason to be ashamed of wanting to sleep at night (Halloween thisyear is on a Sunday, after all). This list is for people wanting to “diptheir toes” into the pool of horror but not fully submerge themselves. Coraline My first recommendation is Coraline. It’s the first creepy movie fromthe stop motion company LAIKA set in Oregon. The second is ParaNorman,which is also amazing and worth a watch. When Coraline has to move from Michigan to Oregon, she loses all of herfriends, and her parents become too busy to spend time with her. All ofthis time alone leads her to become fascinated with the strange door inthe apartment she lives in. She soon discovers it leads to theOtherworld, a world that is a mirror of her own. At first it seemswondrous and full of amazing surprises, but soon the delights theOtherworld offers turn to danger. Coraline carefully walks the tightropebetween horror and fantasy and is a twisted dark fairy tale. The movieis visually stunning. Every character has their own personality andquirks that make them unique and unquestionably memorable, fromCoraline’s parents being gardening bloggers who hate gardening to herneighbor Mr. Bobinsky, who trains mice for a circus. It also boasts oneof the best opening credits scenes I have seen in any movie. Like theOtherworld does for Coraline, this film will suck you into a world younever want to leave. Happy Death Day Happy Death Day is a joy to watch. Its premise is simple and worksbrilliantly: what if Groundhog Day was remade as a slasher film? Themain character, Tree, is having a horrible day. She wakes up in the bedof someone she doesn’t know, her lunch is ruined when she has chocolatemilk spilled on her and she’s stabbed on the way to a party by a personwearing a baby mask. To make matters worse, she’s stuck in a time loop!To escape, Tree has to figure out how to stop her own murder and thefind the identity of the person behind it. Happy Death Day rings trueto the fact it’s a popcorn flick, and has fun with its premise whilecreating sympathetic, likeable characters. Jessica Roth’s Tree is agreat scream queen who you honestly root for. This is also due in partto Roth’s committed performance. The film is light on gore andjump-scares, so it’s perfect for someone who is looking to build uptheir scare tolerance. I would also recommend some of directorChristopher Landon’s other films, like Freaky. Little Shop of Horrors It’s a classic tale of boy, girl and plant. Seymour only wants twothings in the world: to get out of skid row, and the affection of hiscoworker Audrey. He discovers that the solution to his problems is astrange and unusual plant he names Audrey II. The plant soon gainspopularity, but with that popularity comes a hunger for human flesh. Little Shop of Horrors is not only a horror-comedy, but also amusical. It 100% delivers on every one of those elements without feelinglike it tries too hard. The horror elements are not scary, but they haveimpressive practical effects, like the construction and operation ofAudrey II. The movie’s offbeat humor is unique and explosively funny,ranging from Steve Martin’s masochistic dentist’s big musical number toBill Murray’s cameo. Its music was composed by Alan Menken and HaroldAshman, the driving forces behind the “Disney Renaissance”, whichincludes iconic films like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and theBeast. This film has heaps of heart and charm. It’s almost impossibleto leave the film without feeling connected to its two ​​idiosyncraticleads Audrey and Seymour. This film also has (literally) pitch-perfectcasting, including Ellen Greene who was the original Audrey in theoff-Broadway production and Rick Moranis, who brings a great vulnerablequality to Seymour. Halloweentown Halloweentown is a wonderful, whimsical movie. It captures the spiritof Halloween through a younger child’s eyes. Aggie and her siblings arenot allowed to celebrate Halloween. When their grandmother visits, theyare introduced to a whole new world they knew nothing about:Halloweentown. They quickly become attached to the weird, yetmagnificent new setting, but soon learn that it’s threatened by darkforces. Halloweentown is one of the better Disney Channel originalmovies. Debbie Reynolds embodies Aggie, the grandmother of the Cromwellchildren, perfectly. The movie celebrates all Halloween monsters withoutmaking them scary and humanizes them by putting them in the domesticsetting of Halloweentown. I personally have a soft spot for the trope oftaking an element from the fantasy, sci-fi, or horror genre and puttingit into a realistic setting. If you decide to watch Halloweentown, Iwould recommend making this a double feature and watching the sequelHalloweentown II. I hope you enjoy the suggestions. Have a great Halloween, and remember,as Ron Burgundy says: “Stay classy San Diego”! Image source: Creative Commons https://search. creativecommons. org/photos/8c84050e-153b-47bc-add3-77f51a4f9167 "

    "title": "Truth and Reconciliation Day: Reckoning With Canada’s Past and Forging Its Future",
    "body": "2021/09/30 - September 30th is a bit different this year. Maybe you’ve noticed theorange streamers on the Martingrove fence, or the sea of orange t-shirtsin the halls of our school. Today is the National Day for Truth andReconciliation, the first annual holiday for Canada to recognize theharm caused to Indigenous families and communities over the years. It isalso Orange Shirt Day, an annual tradition honouring the survivors ofresidential schools. It makes sense that these two events are happening on the same day. Thehistory of the harm caused to the Indigenous people of Canada is linkedto the lasting legacy of Residential Schools - one of the main causes ofthat suffering. In honour of today, let’s outline a brief history of theharm inflicted on Indigenous people in the past, the progress Canada hasmade today, and the things we need to improve on in the future. In May of 2021, Canadians and people around the world were horrified bythe discovery of the bodies of 215 Indigenous children, found near theKamloops Residential School, which was the largest residential schoolduring the time of their operation. Since then, 1,000 more bodies havebeen found at various Residential Schools, forcing Canada into areckoning over a bloody and cruel history. People tend to think of Residential Schools as a brutal but distant partof the Canadian story. However, the bodies of the 50 identified childrenfound in Kamloops range from 1900, all the way to 1971. From 1874 to1996, Residential Schools in Canada operated as part of a policy offorced assimilation, taking First Nations’ children from their familiesand putting them in state-run boarding schools. This policy strippedthese children not only of their families, culture, and language, butalso their health and well-being - the schools were overcrowded andunderfunded - while many students succumbed to disease and neglect. The shame felt by the actions of our ancestors will live with us always,but it is nothing compared to the trauma inflicted on the First Nationspeople. Those who left the Residential School system alive had poorermental and physical health, and were more likely to suffer from mentaldistress, including depression, and addictive and suicidal behaviours. In the face of such overwhelming cruelty, it is easy to feel guilty andstuck in a rut, like there’s nothing you can do to help. However, thereare little actions you can take to do your part. The first is one wehave started here together: learning the history of Indigenous people. We should take time to reflect on the tragedy of what we know, butshould also educate ourselves on Indigenous culture, history, andtraditions. We’ll recognize Indigenous people as an important part ofCanadian history, and as distinct in their own right. We can also pay attention to the issues Indigenous people currentlyface. There are 58 active boiled water advisories on First Nationsreserves (38 communities without clean water to drink), and an ongoingcrisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW), who represent16% of all murders in Canada between 1980 and 2012, despite being only4% of the population. This is only the beginning of the issuesIndigenous people face. The more we pay attention to these problems, themore media coverage and government intervention will occur. Calling yourMP (never underestimate the power that comes from complaining for a goodcause), or donating to an Indigenous organization like the NativeWomen’s Association of Canada is a great way to make a difference. The last and simplest way to show our support for Indigenous people isto wear orange on September 30th. By doing this, we reckon with Canada’scruel past, and show we are capable of starting the process of makingamends. Our society has taken steps in the right direction - like movingaway from honouring creators of Residential Schools by renaming Ryersonand toppling statues of John A. Macdonald - but there is a long way togo. As we reflect today, we should recognize that although much ofCanada’s past isn’t something to be proud of, Canada’s future could be,and that depends on all of us doing better than the people who camebefore us.

    "body": "2021/09/25 - The 2021 federal election took place a few days ago, and it didn’t endup changing much within the government. In fact, even with the additionof three seats in the House of Commons, the Liberal Party remains inpower with a minority government. While there was previous debate aboutwhether the election results would be divergent, we see now thatparliament has stayed fairly identical. Many Canadians were confused as to why there was an election at all,considering Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberal party were justre-elected in 2019. Leave it to Beacon to fill in all the importantgaps! Back in 2015, the Liberals earned a majority government, meaning theyhad over half the number of seats in Parliament and stable power overall other parties. The Liberals hoped to regain the majority in the nextfederal election of 2019, but fell short by 15 seats. Instead, theyachieved a minority government, where they had the most seats out of anyparty, but not enough to have the majority and ultimately swaygovernment decisions in their favour. According to Trudeau, without amajority government, the Liberals found it challenging to implementlegislation, such as pandemic measures. On August 15th, 2021, Trudeaucalled an early federal election in hopes of retaking control of theHouse of Commons. The Liberal party believed they had generated moresupport over the past two years, as they steered Canada through thedepths of the COVID-19 pandemic. “After making it through 17 months of nothing like we’ve everexperienced, Canadians deserve to choose what the next 17 months, whatthe next 17 years and beyond, will look like. ” -Justin Trudeau Whether or not you support the Liberal party, it is clear they have bigplans to implement within Canada over the coming years. Their call foran election was a calculated risk that did not pay off the way they hadhoped. Yet Trudeau is more than happy with the Liberal victory, sharinghis gratitude with Canadians and stating they are, “back to work with aclear mandate to get Canada through this pandemic, and to the brighterdays ahead, and my friends, that’s exactly what we are ready to do. ”Although this election was sudden, short-lived, and seeminglyunnecessary, we can now look forward and hope that our best days as anation lie ahead. Canadians now see the reasoning behind the election asa strategic venture for the Liberals to gain a majority government, yetthe voters have spoken, opting to keep the federal government virtuallythe same.

    "title": "Summer and Warm Weather: Your Mood Booster",
    "body": "2021/06/30 - Look out the window: do you see the sun shining brightly onto the greengrass? This is just one of many signs the summer months are withinreach. With summer approaching, you may notice a shift in your overallmood. We all feel a certain weight has been lifted off our shoulderswhen the weather begins to warm up (and it’s not just the lack of weightfrom thick winter jackets!). There is a direct correlation betweensummer weather and a better state of mind. Firstly, summer means longer days and brighter sunlight, so there’s moretime to enjoy everything these months have to offer. These extendedhours of sunlight give us more vitamin D, a nutrient that helps with theabsorption of calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D, also known as the“sunshine vitamin”, raises our energy levels, making us feel happier andless tired. A large percentage of Canadians ages 12-19 receive below therecommended amount of vitamin D, classified as almost vitamin Ddeficient. Vitamin D deficiency symptoms include fatigue, muscleweakness, and depression. Being outside during the summer months is away to regain the vitamin D we’ve been missing during winter. It helpsnot only brighten our backyards, but our own moods. According to research from the University of Michigan, warm and sunnyweather can improve attitude, memory, and provide openness to creativethoughts and new information. Their findings suggested that two crucialvariables affect mood: how much time you spend outside and what seasonit is. If an individual usually spends a good amount of time outside,and the season has changed from winter to summer, a noticeable changecan occur. In one study, participants across the United States wererandomly assigned to be outdoors during warm, sunny days. The resultsshowed that these individuals had an improved mood and memory, comparedto those who were outside during poor weather and those who stayedindoors. Interestingly, the researchers also found the ideal temperaturefor people to be 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 22 degrees Celsius. Itwas concluded that for weather to improve mood, one needs to spend atleast 30 minutes outside in warm weather per day. Individuals who stayindoors when the weather is nice outside experience a decrease inoverall mood, and a narrowed cognitive style. Thirdly, the pleasant weather during summer provides incentive to bemore physically active. Whether this involves going for walks, bikerides, playing sports, or working out, an increase in temperature makesit both easier and more enjoyable to get outside and move. Especially inmilder summer temperatures, people tend to express feelings of joy andoptimism. With the provincial restrictions beginning to loosen as well,we are able to inch even closer to normal. There is no doubt thatpreviously negative moods, in large part due to the cold weather andlengthy lockdowns, will begin to shift this summer due to the warmweather. So when you look outside to see the green grass and shiningsun, remember to enjoy the mental benefits that come with this lovelytime of year!

    "title": "Getting Our Act Together: How Canada is (Finally) Winning the Vaccine Race",
    "body": "2021/06/29 - Over a year after the COVID-19 pandemic began, hope is finally on thehorizon. With more and more Canadians getting vaccinated, and COVID-19rates dropping dramatically, the return to a normal life in the nearfuture finally seems possible. According to Our World in Data, Canadarecently beat out Israel. This makes us the global leader in firstvaccination rates, with 64 percent to their 63 percent. When rollouts started in developed countries just a few months ago, itwas hard to imagine we’d reach this point. Canada’s vaccine rollout washardly something to be proud of. Back at the start of March, only 4percent of people in Canada were vaccinated, in comparison to 15. 2percent in the United States, and 55 percent in Israel. The turnaround started around April. This was when the rate ofvaccinations greatly increased, with around 188,000 people receivingvaccines each day. Today, our rate is 375,000 people a day - which isroughly one percent of our population and the highest pace of anycountry. So what changed? The government’s access has been the largestcontributing factor. The Canadian government was largely reliant oncountries such as the U. S. and the U. K. for vaccine supply- but theywere busy supplying their own populations with vaccines made in theirown plants. Canada’s inability to secure vaccines early on in theprocess had an adverse impact on our vaccination rates. Thankfully, there are millions of vaccines coming into Canada now, andfirst-dose vaccinations have continued at a steady rate, with pop-up andmass vaccination clinics aiding the impressive rollout of recent weeks. American cardiologist Eric Topol credits the “culture” of Canada for theimpressive shift, saying that Canadians are more science-based and lesslikely to be “anti-vaxx” than those in his country. Canada’s strategy - of vaccinating as many people with their first doseand delaying the second dose - means we have one of the lowest ratios offirst doses to second doses in the world. However, there is someevidence that giving more Canadians partial protection has contributedto ensuring less people were impacted by the surging third wave. As more people in Canada become fully vaccinated, we can aim our sightson the return to a normal future. All levels of the Canadian governmentare under pressure to give clear guidelines on restrictions that can belifted for people who are fully vaccinated, in a similar manner that TheUnited States’ Centre for Disease Control did. While the Public HealthAgency of Canada says it will offer some guidance eventually, for now,the provinces are largely on their own. Currently in Ontario, fully vaccinated Canadians are expected to followthe same social distancing rules as non-vaccinated people, though theChief Medical Officer of the province is working with experts on rulesfor the fully vaccinated. With the increased vaccination rates for bothfirst and second doses, it is likely that a return to normal will comesooner rather than later.

    "title": "Canada’s Dark Truth: Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women",
    "body": "2021/06/29 - Content warning: This article discusses the Missing and MurderedIndigenous Women and Girls crisis. B. C. Gathering for families of missing and murdered Indigenous womenand girls (BC Gov Photos) Each day, every Indigenous woman wakes up to a nightmare. Otherwise,known as the dark reality of Canada. A reality where Indigenous womenare 12 times more likely to go missing or be killed. A reality where300 Indigenous women go missing in a year- of the known cases atleast. However, this reality is masked with racism, ignorance, andlargely, lack of awareness. Colonialism’s Lasting Effects The root of the ongoing racialization and sexualization of Indigenouswomen is no doubt connected to colonialism. It parallels the developmentof Canada itself, with the topic of settler colonialism being commonamongst both. Colonists normalized violence against Indigenous women andfamilies with the support of policies they created such as forcedsterilization and losing their status if they married a non-StatusIndigenous man. These policies served to limit Indigenous women’s accessto community resources and safety networks. Furthermore, Guthrie Valaskakis, a leading authority on Aboriginal Mediaand Communication, states that early colonial writing depictedIndigenous women as “Indian princesses” that were fetching, proud, andvirtuous. The resistance to such views further catalyzed negativeperspectives on Indigenous women. They became known as “squaws” thatwere dirty, lewd, uncivilized, and sexually deviant. This “heirloom” ofintergenerational trauma is passed down through Indigenous families,often in the form of post-traumatic stress. The Burden of Today The aforementioned characterizations of Indigenous women certainly existto this day. Thus, the grotesque violence that is covered for merely oneGrade 6 class still continues today. The fear and intergenerational trauma that Indigenous women and girlsare burdened with have forced them to use coping strategies thatincrease their vulnerability to violence. These include hitchhiking,addictions, homelessness, and more. Perhaps one has seen these termsveiled as causes for their disappearances, when the real culprit,colonization, is stored away. Is the Government Helping? The answer to this is simply revealed in the negative effects of theIndian Act of 1876. Though published over a century ago, it is still inexistence today. It is known that this sole piece of legislationrestricted Indigenous people of their basic human rights. Relating tothe matter of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, theIndian Act largely supports - and arguably has created - thediscrimination and racism prevalent against Indigenous peoples today. Primarily, the Indian Act is not inclusive when it comes to matrimonialreal property (e. g. family home) on reserve land in the case of amarriage ending. Nothing in the Act affects title to reserve lands. Aswell, the rules on matrimonial property do not apply to First Nationsthat have signed the Framework Agreement on First Nations LandManagement or those who have self-government arrangements. This lack oflegal clarity and protection makes women who have been experiencingviolence or recently widowed prone to losing their homes on the reserve. In short, even one’s home is not a sustainable option when escaping fromviolent and unsafe situations. Yes, one might argue that the government continues to promise to bringjustice to this issue. However, like any other contemporary issue, it ispart of a political agenda. Three-Year Effort Down the Drain An important and highly regarded document called the National Inquiry onMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was published June 3,  It concluded that years of systemic racism and human rightsviolations were a significant factor in the deaths and disappearances ofhundreds of Indigenous women and girls. However, this call for actionhas continually been delayed by the government. “Families, communities, and allies have not received any informationabout what governments – either federal or provincial – have beendoing over the past year on this file,” said Meggie Cywink, whose sisterdisappeared on her respective birthday. No glimpse of solace has been provided to affected families; they areleft with grief and mocked with the government’s inaction. Even so, theCOVID-19 pandemic has been used as an excuse for inaction. This ishighly redundant as Indigenous women are at greater risk of violence dueto the isolation measures in place. The extensive report has created a descriptive framework and plan ofaction for the country, yet the government fails to act on it. It listsmuch-needed initiatives such as: legislation to preserve Indigenouslanguages; giving Indigenous communities control over theirchild-welfare systems; dealing with gender discrimination in the IndianAct. The genocide that exists today is at the hands of the Canadiangovernment. Each life is being dissolved into yet another statistic. Itsounds an alarm for action but it is deafened with systemic racism anddecades of oppression. Canada, please listen. Rhea: This is an amazing article. Eloquent, passionate, forceful. Itmakes for very compelling reading. Very mature and thorough writing. My only caution is: you don’t need the bitterness (flinch, not even aglance) to still make an extremely strong argument. It comes off betterwithout resorting to a very personal level of attack. I totally agreewith you on the facts and without the vitriol. Excellent article and excellent writing. "

    "body": "2021/06/25 - Note from grade-12-Surbhi: This article was my application piecefor the Beacon in grade 9 and is now my final contribution to the club. We’re bringing it full circle folks! I’ll pass it on to grade-9-Surbhi. We’ll talk again at the end. During the summer, family and friends would ask me what grade I was in,so I’d tell them I was going to start ninth grade. I’d always get thesame reaction, “So you’re starting high school. Are you ready?” Iwouldn’t know how to respond because I didn’t know anything about highschool. My perception of high school was based on all the things mymiddle school teachers warned me about - the workload, strict teachers,and tall grade twelves - but getting used to all of those was easycompared to the desks. Don’t get me wrong, I think these desks areamazing in many ways - their tables slightly tilted to the perfect anglefor frantically finishing your third test of the day, their beautifulfluoride-green hue, and the footrest under the seats, just the rightsize for the books you keep in your bag - but built-in chairs? I know I’m not the only one who struggled with the chairs being attachedto the desks. I vividly remember the first few days of school when thedismissal bell was followed by the sound of twenty-five chair-deskhybrids scraping against the floor, and the sight of twenty-fivestudents shifting backwards in unison. We could no longer simply scootour chairs back and stand; instead, we had to snake our way through themaze created by our desk and the one adjacent. It seemed to me thatafter a while, everyone else had moved on and it was only my lonesqueaky struggles echoing through the empty classroom. Signs of growth are already evident in the class of 2021; today, I hearno sounds of those trying to wriggle free from their desk. We’ve doneit. I find myself starting to love what I used to hate about the desks;the chair being attached to the desk may be inconvenient when trying toleave, but I love the innovative 2-in-1 furniture concept. In some way,it makes me feel secure and protected. These desks are no longerobstacles in my mind. I’m starting to feel like a real bear. Now I justneed to figure out where my geography class is. Note from grade-12-Surbhi: Hello again! Though we haven’t gotten tosee our beloved cross-bred seats much this year, I hope you could stillrelate to this article. To the class of 2021: congratulations! I hope you recognize thatwhatever your fears and struggles may have been leaving middle school,you did it. And when you leave high school, you’ll do it again.

    "title": "MCI: The Little Things",
    "body": "2021/06/24 - As this school year comes to a close, and with students missing crucialin-person time at the school, I wanted to take a moment to journey allthroughout the Martingrove lifestyle. Here is a recounting of all thelittle, unique features that fill the school with life and personality,making it a vibrant and interesting place. Chapter 1: The Timeless Opportunities for Thrill Seeking and SpiritualEnlightenment: As we all know, Martingrove’s in-person classes begin at 8:45 in themorning. In fact, a couple years back, the school even had its ownstandard time, independent from geolocation, where all of the clocks inthe school were set 2 minutes ahead of the rest of Ontario. Whether ornot this was intentional, it definitely made getting to school in themorning an even more adventurous affair… There are often those people who arrive at school with 5 minutes left torush to their locker and then to class. The excitement of living on theedge when arriving late to school helps wake them up in the morning. Now, if you do happen to arrive late, you must go through a humblingritual of standing still in the hallway, facing the uncanny smile of thesupervising teacher during the playing of O Canada. In a way, thismakes for a bit of spiritual enlightenment. The national anthem echoingthroughout the vestibule and the murmuring of fellow students creates analmost serene atmosphere, prone to inner self-reflection. Many studentswere there once, standing in shame, repenting their tardy crimes, askingMarty the Bear for forgiveness and most importantly, hoping for enoughstrength to make it to class before the matinal announcements finish andthey are marked late. Chapter 2: The Local Food Hotspots One of the focal points of the MCI morning rush is the large amounts ofdelicious breakfast snacks. Many will be familiar with the world-famousMCI Cheese Bread©, fruits, Melba toast, cheerio packages, andstraight-up loaves of bread that sit in the office hallway, constantlyeyed and picked up by the students throughout the day. Some may haveheard of the school’s cafeteria where you can buy a hearty meal atlunch. We also cannot forget about our local Metro or Tim Horton’s. Butdid you know that Martingrove used to have its own school snack store…and even a hot dog stand? Oh, dearest Bear’s Den, you are still missed! The school’s widely famoussnack store had to close down in 2017. But before it met an untimelyend, it lived a glorious life. Pop, chips, and chocolate galore, Bear’sDen held everything needed for a Martingrove student to fuel themselvesduring the day. Situated in the booth in the southwest corner of theschool’s foyer, the colourful tint of the snack packaging attracted manyBears hoping to satisfy their sweet tooth. Soon after, the Bears becamebees, as the sugar highs asserted their dominance, and students began tobuzz around the school, making for a vibrant afternoon. I would be remiss not to mention our beloved Jerry, who animated and litup the front of the school every lunch when he arrived to sell hiswonderful hot dogs and beverages. Lines formed in front of him evenlonger than those for Bear’s Den, stretching from the street all the wayback to the school’s doors. Unfortunately, at the same time as thebanning of Bear’s Den, Jerry’s presence in front of MCI became a memory. However, we have been informed by a trusty source that he was seenoutside another high school in Toronto, bringing happiness to new faces. Chapter 3: The Secret Math Textbook Office MCI has a second story, but do you know just how big it really is? Weall assume it ends with the classrooms. However, if you can get yourhands on a map of the school, you’ll see that on the east side of thesecond floor, behind the photocopier room is a seemingly unsuspectingdoor. Little did we know that the math textbook storage room was loomingright behind it. Now, this would not be a very interesting part of Martingrove if it wasjust a regular old storage room, however our sources have managed tofind a copy of the school’s floor plan. They have found out that theMath textbook room happens to be huge. It makes you wonder if there arereally that many textbooks to store in there… We here at the Beacon have a connection to an investigative journalistwho was able to get a glimpse on the inside. According to them, it wasfilled with rows and rows of intimidating textbooks, but they insistthat this is a cover-up. Our connection had with them a radiationdetector which reported traces of Hawking’s radiation deeper in theroom. We here at the Beacon have reasons to believe that secret researchprojects are currently taking place in MCI’s math textbook room thatstudy the nature of gravity in an effort to create a wormhole to adifferent universe. Knowing how heavy most of the math textbooks are,this does not seem far off. Chapter 4: The Best Parts of the Music Hallway We shall not forget the Strings and Band rooms with the memorabilia onthe walls, pictures of generations and generations of virtuoso studentsand competition trophies won year after year by the pupils of Mr. Stoica, Ms. McAskill and, in the future, pupils of Ms. Chang. There is something inspiring in the way the instruments line up alongthe walls like well-trained soldiers. The old piano tells stories ofstudents playing Fur Elise during impromptu concerts during breaksbetween rehearsals. Mr. Stoica’s bubble gum dispenser sat in the cornerof the strings room, always mysteriously filled in. Next door is the auditorium, a witness of glorious Winter and Springconcerts, galas, and ceremonies year after year for welcoming newstudents, graduations, and commencements. Walking now on the eery silenthallways one could imagine hearing the cheerful voices of generationsand generations of teenagers full of hopes and dreams who coloured thewalls and ceilings with their liveliness. Chapter 5: The Fitting Meaning of MCI’s Motto What would a recounting of all things MCI be without mentioning ourschool’s windowless nature? Window jokes have become a centerpiece inthe Martingrove lore. Many origin stories have been created detailinghow the school’s unique architecture came to be. Some say the lack ofwindows was meant as a way of conserving heat during the Torontonianwinters. Others claim the school was once used as a bunker during thewar. One of our very own Beacon writers has written an article about oneof MCI’s most interesting origin stories that you can check out. The truth is that Martingrove is a special school regardless of thebuilding architecture. There are fabulous teachers and support staff whoare diligently opening windows in students’ minds to create, todiscover, to see the world from different perspectives, and to soar tothe sky. Throughout my time at the school, I have met people withcreative and vibrant personalities, and I have seen active, welcomingclubs and teams. Altogether, it makes the school stand out because ofthe hard work and talent of its amazing students and teachers. This iswhat truly gives life to our school motto: Lumen in Vobis Est - “TheLight is Within You!” "

    "title": "Interview with Mr. Stoica",
    "body": "2021/06/22 - 1.  How long did you teach and what subjects did you teach? I retired last year in 2020. I taught for almost 40 years! I first started teaching in Deva, Romania on September 15, 1981 at amusic and arts school. I taught violin one-on-one, string orchestra, andchamber music. After a few years, I started to teach viola and a littlebit of contrabass. In 1996, I came to Canada. I taught private lessons and volunteered atschools. When I started at Martingrove in 2000, I taught one string class, onevocal class, career studies, and geography. It was difficult because Ihad a language barrier - I was fluent in French but not English. Then,every year I reduced the number of career studies, and geography classesI taught and grew the string program. 2.  What was your favourite part about teaching these subject(s)? I loved playing and performing. In my interview for the TDSB, I wasasked what I want to do in 5 years. I said, “I want to create one of thebest string programs in Etobicoke. ” I accomplished that by creating thestring program at Martingrove. Strings is my life, so I always preferred teaching Strings, but I alsoreally liked teaching Beginner’s Band. I really liked the sound of theinstruments and the students were very funny. Band was alwaysinteresting. I think the best part overall was going on the music trip every otheryear and performing at the end. 3.  Do you have a memory that stands out to you from teaching outside  of school? Before working at Martingrove, I had 42 private students. My laststudent was 62 years old. She asked me if I could teach her to playcarols in three months for her 90-year-old mother. When she played, hermom was very pleased and sang along. It was very nice. 4.  How long have you been playing the violin? I started playing the violin at four and a half.  Mr. Stoica (right) playing the violin at his first in-school concert insenior kindergarten. This is a picture from my first performance. I didn’t have a stand. Theperson standing in front of me was one of my colleagues. They weresupposed to be the same height as me but I was short.  Mr. Stoica (right) dancing in a play in senior kindergarten. This was my first play as a senior kindergartener. Was I a good dancer? Mr. Stoica playing the violin in grade 2. This was one of my first public performances. 5.  Who is your favourite composer? Oh, Bach of course. I love Bach. If you listen carefully to everythinghe’s writing - whether it’s for orchestra, cello, violin - there’salways at least one inner melody. No one believed in him while he wasalive. He only became famous after he died. He was teaching people howto extract three or four melodies at once. I also like Beethoven because he changed every single style. Herecreated music and opened the door for romantic composers. 6.  What’s your favourite memory from your time at MCI? The best was when we won best of class in a competition against CardinalCarter - an arts school where all the music students take privatelessons. We were invited to perform on the same stage where Tafelmusik,the baroque orchestra, performs. That was fantastic. Also, all the concerts were fantastic moments for me, as well as beingwith students in class. It doesn’t matter what happened, when I went into the string room andclosed the door, it was a different life for me, like I was Aquaman inwater. 7.  What is your favourite memory from when you were a high school  student? The last three months of high school were my favourite. There were 40 students in our graduating year. We were like a family. Every weekend in the last month of our final year, my classmates and Iwent to each teacher’s house and sang ‘Gaudeamus’ in front of theirhouse to thank them, a tradition in East Europe. At prom, we invited all our teachers. At midnight, the orchestraconductor, one of my favorite teachers, opened the door. He came withfour cases of beer. He opened the door and said, “Starting right now,you are not students, you are adults. You should share a glass with us[teachers] and call us by our first names. ” It was like he was saying‘Hey, you’re not kids anymore. Time to go. ’ * * The legal drinking age in Romania at the time was 16. 8.  What do you miss the most about teaching at MCI? Being, playing, and performing with students. I miss the string class, orchestra, concerts, and festivals. Also,helping students who don’t know how to do something. That I’ll miss alot. I’ll also miss the chamber ensembles and quartets. They kept me young! 9.  What have you enjoyed in your first year of retirement? I have a piano in my basement and I’ve been writing the piano part ofsome pieces on my computer. I’ve also been arranging Romanian dances fora string quartet, composing a symphony for strings, practicing violin,and reading. Also, since my wife is still working from home, I decidedto help her. I’ve been cooking every single day. Now I’m pretty good! I’ve also been planting tomatoes and I have lots of roses in mybackyard. 10.  Any final words of advice for MCI students? First of all, I’d like to congratulate all graduating students forfinishing this terrible year. You did amazing work this one and a halfyears. Working online on a computer - it’s not human. It’s a greataccomplishment. I wish you luck. To my strings students, I hope you will remember all the advice I gaveyou to enjoy life and play. Join a community orchestra and play - youdon’t have to be good, just play. Be in touch with your instrument. Teach your kids a little bit of music. Take care in university. Don’t party too much because it will take yourbrain out of what it needs to do. Don’t study too much because you’ll gocrazy. Share what you do with us teachers because we will be proud. And… A photo of Mr. Stoica’s Star Wars figures - they move! … may the force be with you in university and life! Image Source: All images are from Mr. Stoica. "

    "title": "But Is Your Clothing Smart?",
    "body": "2021/05/15 - In this day and age, the term “smart” has been frequently associatedwith the likes of phones, TVs, and even refrigerators. However, there isnow a new addition to this list: the Levi’s x Google Jacquard. Yes, inother words, it is a smart jacket. Functions such as double tapping tochange the song and swiping left to answer a call are pretty familiaramong our hands. Now, you can perform them on your own clothing! The Levi’s Commuter Trucker x Jacquard jacket is the very first clothingitem designed with Google’s revolutionary smart clothing technology. Named Project Jacquard, it aims to ease the processes of communication,navigation, and entertainment for its wearers. This jacket has theability to control music, phone calls, get directions, and even receiveUber alerts. Don’t worry, it is compatible with Bluetooth and its veryown Jacquard App. The groundbreaking technology relies on the delicacy of the threads asthis touch sensitive technology is woven into it as a piece of fabric. This piece of fabric operates by using conductive metal threads that areintertwined with regular fibres to create a new type of fabric thatmaintains the normalized look of denim, masking its intelligentfunctions. Fortunately, Project Jacquard won’t fall victim to its own brand ofconsumer culture that exists in this world today as it has no plans toopen any factories. Instead, they are planning to collaborate on otherdesigns with brands that are already established as retailers. However,it may enter with a competitor. Other smart clothing exists! UnderArmour has created the HOVR Sonic Sneaker that tracks performancestatistics during a workout and Wearable X has designed the Nadi X YogaPants to differentiate when the wearer loses proper yoga form during asession. With smart clothing, the barrier between us and technology is literallyas thin as a thread. Being woven into the very fibres of our clothing,it brings the question, how connected to technology do we want to be?Also, is it washing machine safe?

    "body": "2021/04/01 - MCI students have changed much of their school life to combat theCovid-19 virus. We have to wear masks, socially distance, and use thequadmester system, if we are going to school at all. However, we stillhave the luxury of using the amazing Martingrove washrooms, a luxurythat we may also have to give up. In a secret meeting with Beacon staff,the administration at our school revealed their plans to ban the use ofour bathrooms, mandating instead MCI Bear diapers for all students. We’ve decided to break the news to the public, as this is a great blowto our community. Of course, we must take all measures necessary to combat this pandemic. If that means wearing diapers, then so be it. We recognize that this maybe a change, but honestly, it is a return to a simpler time. Just 14years ago, most Martingrove students would have been walking around witha diaper anyway, so this might be just the change we need to be morecomfortable at school. This is not only for in person students though. Because Martingrove aimsto be inclusive and incorporate everyone into our community, the schoolhas decided that virtual students will also partake in this diaperwearing. This is to unite the students and have us all feel the bearspirit. All students can pick up their Bear Diaper at the main office onMonday and Tuesday. Remember, we’re all in this together!

    "title": "🥓 Taylor Swift To Quit Music Forever?",
    "body": "2021/04/01 - Many feelings arose when this news developed: Taylor Swift, named “themusic industry” herself, is going to quit music forever. These werelargely feelings of shock, frustration, and confusion, followed byexperiencing all her albums again. Noted, there was previously a similar scare in a candid interview withRolling Stone, where Taylor Swift revealed she almost quit makingmusic. However, this time, sources reveal that this news is real. “After the sudden and highly welcomed releases of Folklore andEvermore, Taylor Swift is to stop making new music,” revealed atrusted source. It is predicted that she will be focusing solely on herre-recordings. Although this unexpected announcement is saddening, one can find joy inlooking at the bright side of things. With re-recordings, we can returnto our childhoods, and additionally, hear lyrical masterpieces that wereoriginally in the “vault” but have made a joyous escape engrossed inparentheses. Additionally, hardcore Swifties are known to overthink, toa point where they are counting the amount of spaces Taylor Swift hasput between her captions and if they have any relation to the number 13. Surprisingly, there is nothing irrational about this practice, as“easter eggs” are hidden on a consistent and bordering maniacal basisfor this artist. Yet, throughout all of this, disbelief is a feeling that will definitelybe shared. Largely because of the fact that TS13 is yet to be released. As strange as this may seem to the common folk, it has valid reasoningbehind it. A person who plans for the release dates of her albums to addup to “13” cannot possibly not have thirteen albums in her discography. So perhaps, this news is an easter egg within itself. Is someone goingto count the number of letters and the exact second to which this wasposted? However, for some reason, if it is in fact true, manifesting itto be false is always an option.

    "body": "2021/04/01 - The Coronavirus is rapidly spreading, with over 126 million cases and2. 76 million deaths. But that is not the virus we should be concernedabout. Four days ago, students at the University of Toronto found an unknownstrain of virus in a young man’s bloodstream. He had been going on aboutthe anime The Promised Neverland nonstop. He also had an extremelyhigh fever, a sore throat, severe pain in his chest and a splittingheadache. Two days later, he fell into a coma, after his sister had toldhim that his waifu was not real and passed away twelve hours later. Ever since then, Canadian citizens started showing similar symptoms asthe deceased man. From the research, medical scientists have gatheredthat this virus is caused by watching anime, reading manga and/or lightnovels, as well as playing anime styled video games. As a result,victims will gain a sudden obsession of Japanese pop culture. Due tothis, researchers have decided to call this strain of virus “Animeitis”. “My daughter has always found anime “geeky” and “childish”. Next thing Iknow, she is hooked on the Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure franchise. Shehas been binge watching it nonstop,” a tearful mother reports. There have also been reports of individuals believing that anime is realor that they are in an anime. For instance, a woman in Vancouver hasbeen trying to awaken her “Quirk” to no avail. She has also startedcosplaying as characters from My Hero Academia. This virus has already infected millions of people across Canada, aswell as a few hundred cases in the States. Many provinces are now inlockdown, including Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia andAlberta. President Joe Biden is considering putting the entire U. S. inlockdown as well. Many world leaders have also put their countries inlockdown, as they are afraid their own citizens suffer Animeitis aswell. We still have little knowledge on Animeitis, but Ontario’s Ministry ofHealth’s President, Iain Stewart, has told us which symptoms to watchout for, as well as how to prevent the virus from spreading further. “The usual symptoms of COVID-19; fatigue, fever, sore throat, diarrhea,headaches, and difficulty breathing are present. A sudden obsession withanime, and in worst cases, believing that it is nonfiction are thesymptoms that differentiate Animeitis from the superior virus. ” Stewartsays. “As for precautions to take, don’t go outside unless youabsolutely have to. If you do, wear a mask and avoid interacting withpeople. Since the virus can spread at a wide range compared to thecoronavirus, stay at least twelve feet away from others instead of onlyseven. Wash your hands frequently and sanitize. Avoid touching yourface, eyes, nose and mouth. And most importantly, do not come intocontact with anything anime based. ” “And if your loved ones have been infected, do not, under anycircumstances, tell them that anime is not real. This will cause them toeither have a severe heart attack or stroke. All individuals who havebeen told this harsh reality have died shortly after,” he reportsgravely. “Instead, have them self-isolate immediately. The recoveryprocess is the exact same as COVID-19. If we work together, we cancombat Animeitis. ” Animeitis is still being researched around the world and a vaccine isyet to be developed. One major question being asked is if it is possiblefor those infected with the virus to become sicker upon being furtherexposed to Japanese entertainment, including anime, JMMORPGS, manga,light novels and J-pop. But rest assured that once infected, cases willnot worsen. All we can do now is pray that we can put an end to thisbefore it gets out of hand.

    "body": "2021/04/01 - Meghan Markle has been a source of scandal in the British tabloids,upending many longstanding royal traditions. Among her alleged crimesare being multiracial, being a woman, being American, having parents,and existing. Yet her landmark Oprah interview in March led togroundbreaking journalists at Mail on Sunday discovering something farmore nefarious about the Duchess of Sussex - her breathing during theinterview. “We watched this video clip maybe a hundred times,” said bleary-eyedintern Leah Wimbleton. “We noticed that Markle displays a concerningneed for oxygen. See here, how she breathes between words? There’ssomething fishy going on. ” Self-described mature individual Piers Morgan was quick to offer hisinput on the shocking behaviour. “At the ten-minute mark, Meghanbreathes for nine seconds. The same number of letters in Voldemort’sname. Coincidence? I think not. It’s obvious, Meghan Markle is declaringher support for Death Eaters. ” QAnon fundraiser and self-proclaimed “clown entrepreneur” David Joneshad his own take on the story. “I’ve heard rumours that Darth Vader alsobreathes. I think there’s more connections between Markle and the Siththen the fake news media would lead you to believe. ” Markle’s breathing has also been linked to an avocado shortage in SouthAmerica, and higher infant mortality rates, according to Leslie Wilbur. “I saw it on Facebook,” she said. “Who does she think she is, taking theprecious breathing air that could go to children and babies? I don’tthink that climate change is real, or anything, but Meghan’s breathingsure does cause a lot of CO2 emissions. ” At press time, Meghan Markle’s breathing was also linked to COVID-19,the fall of the Roman Empire, and multiple Arkham Asylum breakouts inGotham.

    "body": "2021/04/01 - Last week, a series of tragic events occurred, starting with the mysterious eye of Eveloin Rib. But don’t worry - there’s mutton to fret about. “It all started in Science, last Monday morning,” said the Grade Ninestudent. “I was trying to pay attention, and then one of my eyes poppedout. ” Eveloin Rib’s eye gracefully leapt from its socket, witnessesrecalled, at 9:07 A. M. on Monday, rolling out the door and into thehallway. After pausing briefly to look out the window, it made its waythrough the Science hallway and tumbled down the stairs, although mysources do not specify when or how. The whole Science class spent themorning searching for the rogue eye, with no luck, but at last, Rib’seye was found cooling off in a water fountain. Like most of Eveloin’s classmates, Hamantha Mince was very relieved. “I’m just glad Eveloin’s eye was found. It would be unsettling knowingthat a stray eyeball still roams the halls of Meatingrove. “Wouldn’tthat be so unsettling?” said Mince in our interview yesterday. Eveloinis recovering in the hospital, and she will return to school by Monday. On behalf of all members here at The Bacon, I am extremely relieved forboth Eveloin and her reunited eye. As if a runaway eye wasn’t enough for our school last week, The Bacon’ssuper top-secret undisclosed headquarters were found ablaze on Tuesday,with no one at the scene. Although no one was there, sources state thata math test belonging to Grade Ten student Vee Ande was foundsuspiciously close to the cause of the fire: a can of Spam ignited bypyrokinetic powers. The Spam can appears to remain sealed and unchanged,so if anyone is looking for a meaty snack during breaktime, The Bacon’ssuper top-secret undisclosed headquarters are always open. Vee Ande was found the day after in the parking lot, pointing at similarcans of Spam and muttering to herself, “You meathead, it was just amisteak,” as she lit them on fire. I’m not pointing any fingers here,but I am. Thankfully, no one was injured, and the damage from the Spamfire was minute. It’s safe to say that we avoided being smoked bacon. In international news, the distant relative of Grade Twelve studentChuck Ram was knighted last week. Chuck’s recount of how he and SirAlexhamder Loin OBE are related was a convoluted mess to listen to, butI will take his word for it. Sir Loin entered knighthood on the 27th ofMarch at Buckingham Palace, being knighted Officer of the Most ExcellentOrder of the Brifish Empire by Queen Elizabeef II, for globalcontributions in the field of Physribs. Loin gave a very tender andheartwarming speech afterwards, followed by a lovely performance of “IWanna Hold Your Ham’’ by The Beefles. Last week was certainly filled with mayham, but we are just happyeveryone is safe and sound.

    "title": "🥓 The Reason MCI Doesn’t Have Windows",
    "body": "2021/04/01 - Hey Bears! Regardless of how long you’ve been at MCI, you’ve definitelynoticed that our school lacks a significant thing: windows. We, at theBeacon, recently came across ancient MCI history books, and discoveredthe reason why our school doesn’t have windows. We feel that it is ourjournalistic duty to share this information with you, so behold, thetrue story of why MCI does not have windows. Enjoy! MCI was designed in the 1960s by a man known as the Great Baron ofMartingrove, E. N. Closure. His family was of great wealth and statushere in Etobicoke, yet the Baron was the last living member. It’simportant to mention that the Baron’s family had a bitter rivalry withthe other resident affluent family, the Fenetres. The two families hadbeen disagreeing for centuries, ever since their great grandfathers gotinto an argument about the true solution of 1+1. Their dispute resultedin a violent cheese bread fight, but then ended with a group of geesechasing them both away. The Baron wanted to build a school in his family’s name, to maintaintheir legacy. He had many lavish plans for the school: great bighallways, spacious lockers, adorned with beautiful school colours ofgreen and white, and most importantly, lots of glorious windows. TheBaron was just about to begin constructing this very school, when hereceived the list of students who would be enrolling. All was in order,until he saw one name at the very bottom of this list: Lisa Fenetre, theyoungest member of the rival Fenetre family. She would be attendinggrade 9 at the Baron’s school. This sent the Baron into a fury, and dueto his blind rage towards the Fenetres, he completely scrapped all hisplans for the school. Most notably, he knew that the Fenetres lovednatural light and looking outside, so he decided not to put any windowsin any classrooms. They would only be in the stairwells and at the endsof the hallways. He wanted Lisa’s school experience to be miserable, andfor her to spend countless hours in math class actually learning what1+1 is, without distractions. A few days later, Lisa Fenetre’s father, Charles, got word of theBaron’s punishing plans for Lisa and the school. He was outraged, andwent to visit the Baron’s house on a street that was, at the time,called Summerton. The two had a long fight; one so brutal and cold thatit caused a chill throughout the street. Finally, the Baron couldn’ttolerate the verbal insults any longer. He went inside his house, andemerged minutes later with handfuls of Jerry’s hotdogs, which he beganthrowing at Mr. Fenetre. “Get out of here, get off my property! I’m going to build the mostenclosed school in all of Etobicoke!” shouted the Baron. And because of the sheer power of Jerry’s hotdogs, Mr. Fenetre wasforced to concede, and return to his own home. The Baron, now unopposed,was free to proceed with his plans. He built his school of regularhallways, decorated with dull brown and orange school colors, and nowindows. As desired, he named the school Martingrove, after his ownfamily’s title. That year, Lisa Fenetre attended Martingrove in the fall. She, alongwith the rest of her family, was repulsed by the lack of windows withinthe classrooms. Lisa transferred to Richview three months into theschool year. She went on to live a good life, but never did learn what1+1 actually equalled. (do you know?!) After the triumph of building his school, yet unable to truly punish theFenetres, the Baron sadly died at the age of 81. He died due toexcessive consumption of cheese bread, while surrounded by hiscollection of computers that never connect to the school wifi. TheMartingrove legacy lives on through his school, and all those who attendit. On that note, we end the fascinating story of why MCI doesn’t havewindows. We hope you learned something valuable through this story, andalways remember the supremacy of Jerry’s hotdogs. Without them, ourschool may not have existed!

    "title": "The Graviton: Future Fuel",
    "body": "2021/03/21 - Have you ever been filling the tank to your new spaceship and thought,“I wish there was a better way to power the engine. ” Enter the Graviton!With its subatomic superpower, its potential applications areunimaginable. To understand the graviton, we must first understand a bit of quantummechanics. The main principle is that everything is made of quanta – orpackets – of energy and these quanta behave as both particles and waves. Take visible light, for example, which is composed of packets ofelectromagnetic energy, or photons. There are four fundamental forces in the universe: gravity,electromagnetic force, weak and strong nuclear forces. All of these,except for gravity, have been proven to follow the laws of quantummechanics. This means they have specific subatomic “exchange particles”that interact with other particles to cause these forces. Electromagnetic force is caused by the photon. Strong nuclear force istraceable to the gluon. Weak nuclear force is transmitted by themovement of W and Z bosons. Knowing this, scientists predict that the elementary particle whichcauses apples to fall onto our heads and shooting stars to traverse thenight, is the graviton! If this mysterious particle exists, it isexpected to have no mass, no charge, and travel at the speed of light,similar to a photon. Though still considered theoretical, physicistslike Zvi Bern continuously challenge themselves to calculate thebehaviours of this particle with increasing precision, which involvestaking on new perspectives of the universe – even one where space-timeis an illusion. So if it fits with quantum mechanics and scientists can already predictits properties, why hasn’t the graviton been proven to exist yet? Forone, gravity is extremely weak, and as physicist Freeman Dyson oncestated, the detector needed to prove the graviton’s existence would haveto be so massive it would “collapse into a black hole. ” However, there is an even larger factor that has plagued the physicsworld for nearly a century: the struggle to unify Einstein’s Theory ofGeneral Relativity with quantum theory. Both have vastly different viewson gravity. While Einstein’s theory states gravity is an attractiveforce as the result of matter distorting space-time, quantum theoryviews gravity as being caused by the transferring of gravitons betweenparticles. Merging these two theories – and proving it – has been acomplex task for physicists, giving rise to fascinating hypotheses fromString Theory to pulling an Interstellar and falling into a black hole. It is only a matter of time until the existence of the graviton – or itsfuture equivalent – is proven. When it is, it will help us createnumerous mind-bending applications! The most intriguing being anentirely new way to fuel transportation. By harnessing a way tomanipulate the graviton, just as we manipulate the emission of photonsto create light, gravity can be used for future space travels. For example, we can facilitate more efficient spacecraft propulsion. Bymanipulating an area near a rocket to have a higher concentration ofgravitons, we can increase that area’s gravity, pulling the rockettowards this increased gravitational zone. This would work the same aswhen a spaceship loops around a planet to take advantage of itsgravitational field and increase its velocity. Now, instead of needingfuel to accelerate a spaceship, we can use gravity to our advantage. An even more ambitious application: creating our own wormhole to anotherpart of the universe! By greatly increasing the concentration ofgravitons in a certain area, we could succeed in curving space-time tocreate a shortcut to a different part of space – or even time. For now these are all just speculations. However, it is important toremember that scientific progress has evolved exponentially. Just over100 years ago, it was thought that neutrons and protons were thesmallest particles to exist. Yet, the discovery of quarks and even morefundamental particles have unveiled another layer in our quest todiscover the ultimate fabric of the universe. Although we may only be at the beginning of our journey of learning howthe universe works, that doesn’t keep us from searching further. We mustcontinue laying the foundations for our future discoveries, ceaselesslyreviving the world of science. "

    "title": "Capitol Hill Riots: Could It Happen Here?",
    "body": "2021/03/17 - On January 6, 2021, an armed insurrection occurred at the United StatesCapitol. This was the outcome of months of priming, where many electedofficials got their followers to believe things that would justify anattack on democracy. The question arises: could this happen in Canada?Let’s analyze the chain of events that led to the riots to figure itout. The uprising started with the delegitimizing of the mail-in ballots. Asearly as last April, former President Trump tweeted, “Republicans shouldfight very hard when it comes to state-wide mail-in voting. Democratsare clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and forwhatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans…” By doing this,he initiated the idea that mail-in ballots are fraudulent, and shouldnot be counted. He continued to reiterate this up until the election. InCanada, this could definitely happen. Someone could suggest that therecould be mail-in fraud and that we should do everything possible to havea “free and fair” election. But would that be enough to start riots atParliament Hill? On November 7, 2020, when Joe Biden was declared the winner of thePresidential election, Trump and the majority of the Republican Partyclaimed that the entire election was rigged through mail-in ballots andvoter suppression in favour of Democrats. The idea of a stolen electionbrought America one step closer to the riots, because it wasn’t justimplying that there was a likelihood of fraud, but that the entireelection was rigged. Again, this could happen here in Canada. Theelection could be questioned. But would these two things be enough tocause a riot? Then, on January 6, there was a MAGA (Make America Great Again) rally inWashington D. C. . Trump’s speech was inflammatory; it was clear that heand the other speakers were pushing for what happened next. It startedwith the usual claims of election fraud. Then he proceeded to say that“History is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we havegreat and courageous leaders or whether or not we have leaders thatshould be ashamed of themselves throughout history. ” This is a clearcall to action. During the entire speech, there were lies in almostevery phrase such as, “This is the most corrupt election in the history,maybe of the world. ” The way he ended his speech was one of his mostovert incitements of insurrection. “So we’re going to, we’re going towalk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’regoing to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats arehopeless…But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weakones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going totry and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to takeback our country. ” This messaging was being fed to a mob that alreadyfelt as though they had all been cheated. They managed to breach theCapitol, desecrate it, and try to attack congresspeople. Eventually itwas dealt with, and they were removed, but the ideological meaningbehind this shows the great divide in our society. The dogmatism of theMAGA movement is clear, and because Trump is their divine figure, theywill defend him at the cost of democracy. Refusing the results of anelection because your candidate lost is anti-democratic because itundermines the entire foundation of the system. January 6 was the climaxof election tensions and something this drastic most likely wouldn’thappen in Canada. There would only be a portion of the population thatwould believe in the possibility of fraud, and most Canadians probablywould not want to engage in violence. This is a drastic step thatCanadians wouldn’t take. However, claims of fraudulent ballots and the questioning of validity ofsome ridings are two valid possibilities. Regardless, this wouldn’t leadto an uprising as it did in the United States. In a recent poll by AngusReid, less than 1 in 5 Canadians believe that the U. S. election wasunfair. An even smaller number would attend a violent rally to protestthat. Even more proof of this is the Canadian federal government’sdecision, on February 3, to declare the Proud Boys as a terroristentity. The Proud Boys are a far-right, neo-fascist group that regularlyengages in, and provokes, political violence. This decision was onlypossible because our politics are, in general, more left-leaning. Further Reading: Post-Riot Events After the insurrection, Trump was permanently banned from his socialmedia platforms, because the respective companies didn’t want to beassociated with him. His Twitter account had peddled blatantmisinformation in regards to election fraud and far-right conspiracytheories. After Trump’s social media removal, there was also a purge ofmany other far-right accounts across social media platforms, so theycould distance themselves from the January 6 attack. This wouldn’thappen here; our political climate would have to change drastically forone of our politicians to engage in activity that could get them bannedfrom social media. Trump then decided to not attend President Biden’s inauguration. He wasthe first outgoing President to not attend his successor’s inaugurationsince Andrew Johnson in 1869. This shows the intense divisivenesssurrounding the election, and the extreme lack of unity. If Trump hadaccepted his loss and been at the inauguration, it could have calmeddown some of the political tension in America. The inauguration itselfhad much more security than usual to prevent any violence like theinsurrection at the Capitol, and nothing happened. This was the finalmoment of the transfer of power, and the end of claims of ‘Trump canstill win’. This is something that Canadians would never do. Out ofpoliteness alone, they would attend their opponent’s swearing-inceremony. This timeline shows how a claim as simple as questioning the validity ofmail-in ballots can spiral into an insurrection at the centre of acountry’s democracy. Even though we might not get to that final stepanytime soon, we still have to remain wary of these problems becausethey aren’t unique to America. Canadians are not immune to the samerhetoric that is used in the United States. Many of the incrementalthings that happened there could also happen here. A Léger poll inSeptember showed that only 16% of Canadians support Donald Trump. However, when you break this number down it is more revealing; 41% ofCanadians who are affiliated with the Conservative Party of Canadasupport Trump. Pro-Trump rallies took place in Toronto and Calgary onJanuary 6. This is an issue across all of North America. To combat this,we need to restore faith in science, and continue to persist inde-radicalizing people from the right, to prevent other attacks such asthe Capitol Hill riot, or other anti-democracy movements such as#stopthesteal. Another tactic is to make these movements politicallyirrelevant. 34% of Americans and 33% of Canadians didn’t vote in theirlatest federal elections. Appealing to this demographic and getting themto vote would help a great deal in stopping violence and ending theundermining of our democratic values. An attack on Parliament Hill isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Despitethat, many actions and ideas adjacent to the attack are definitelypossible. It is up to us to stop them. "

I am Love by Ruchi Tilva won 2nd place , and Nighttime Reminiscence by Orikto Ahmad won 3rd place. Thank you to everyone who participated! Flowers: One sunny morning in the month of May,A cheerful gardener was making her wayTo her town’s annual flower displayTo bring her girlfriend a gift. Her cart piled high with all kinds of flowers,(Beautiful blue ones that smelled of spring’s showersAnd striking red ones that bloomed many hours)Her step was steady and swift. On the side of the road she spotted a man,His face turned down, his head in his hand,Muttering something ‘bout the fates of the damned,An empty bottle beside him. The gardener reached a hand down into her cartAnd pulled out an orchid the shape of a heart. The man startled, raised his head with a startAnd beheld the flower before him. But already, the gardener was walking once more,And already, poor travellers she met by the score. And already, she reached in the cart mentioned beforeTo give each one a flower. And though the feelings of goodwill grew,As her flowers depleted, the gardener knewHer stock would run out, clear and true,‘Ere the end of the hour. And surely enough, the flowers ran outAnd the gardener was left not a single sproutTo bring to her girlfriend, who was still, no doubt,Waiting in the town square. Now heavy hearted, the gardener walked on,Wondering what her girlfriend would think of flowers gone. Then at long last, she finally came uponHer town, up ahead of her. The gardener walked in the village, then looked ‘round,To spy her girlfriend, whom she quickly foundOver by the fountain, sitting on the ground,Waving the gardener over. Taking a breath, the gardener walked t’ward her,Wondering how she’d ever explain where the flowers were. The next few moments felt like a blurBut finally, she told her. Her girlfriend laughed, and said with a smile,“I don’t care about gifts, so long as you spend a whileOf your time with me, after walking many miles,It is you whom I have missed. ”A smile broke out across the gardener’s faceAnd the rest of the day, they stayed in placeEnjoying the other’s company and good graceAnd neither ever thought to resist.

    "body": "2021/02/08 - The unease across North America was palpable on January 6th, 2021. Whether you were watching the news, listening to the radio while drivinghome, or getting updates on Twitter, everyone was in disbelief as angrysupporters of Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol. It seemedincredulous that a group of pro-Trump rioters could have the boldness towreak such havoc and succeed. But our shock on the 6th was not justified: history and literature haswarned us for centuries that discrimination-based tensions always riseto the surface, and that beliefs in supremacy often result in danger tothose that don’t fit the mould. We should’ve been expecting a situationlike this, due to the racist nature of the attackers (people thatsupport Trump so avidly are almost always racist. ) Racial tensions havebeen bubbling in the United States for decades, but they reached aboiling point this past summer with a resurgence of the Black LivesMatter movement. This wasn’t our only warning. Literary stories ofviolent injustice have time and time again mirrored what we’re facingnow. Look, for example, at Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. The Handmaid’s Tale is undoubtedly a story of injustice. It followsOffred, a woman under the patriarchal dystopian rule of Gilead, who isenslaved to be a child bearer. This story defines gender injusticerather than racial, but follows the same pattern of today’s challenges,starting with an event that parallels the attack on the Capitol. In The Handmaid’s Tale, the emergence of The Republic of Gilead wasspurred by an effective coup d’etat by the leaders of Gilead, the Sonsof Jacob, during which they “shot the President and machine-gunned theCongress… the entire government, gone like that…” (Atwood 162). Soundfamiliar? It should. If Capitol security had not been so quick toevacuate members of the Senate, including Vice President Mike Pence andVice President-elect Kamala Harris, maybe we would have faced aHandmaid’s Tale-esque situation of assasination. After all, many ofthe rioters were carrying guns and homemade explosives. But an even moreprominent parallel between the Sons of Jacob and the Capitol attackersis their beliefs. The standout belief among Trump’s most resolute supporters is theirwhite supremacist ideology. The Capitol rioters are the same people whopraised Trump’s racist immigration laws and his numerous raciststatements during his presidency; denounced the Black Lives Mattermovement and countered it with the mocking statement “All Lives Matter”;and continued to not care when black people were murdered by the policetime and time again, but rather praised the officers who did so. I’mscared of these people; we all should be. These rioters’ opinions are reflected in the obvious ones of the Sons ofJacob. For these men, having rank above all women is a fulfillment oftheir belief in male supremacy. This is exactly the belief of Trump’sarmy of white supremacists, just in terms of race rather than gender. Just as the Sons of Jacob are living in their own personal utopia whilethe women below them are in a tortuous dystopia, these whitesupremacists believe that the world should be made to suit their beliefsdirectly. Regardless of the common good, they care only for their ownbenefit and fulfillment of their personal ideology. The desire for whitesupremacy is directly achieved by having a white supremacist in highoffice; the loss of the rioters’ grand wizard spurred their attack. Therefore, these two instances are equal; one is a belief in malesupremacy, the other in white supremacy - but they’re cut from the samecloth. The Trump-crazed attackers of the Capitol compare to the Sons of Jacobin many ways. But this concept of supremacy, whether of skin colour orgender, is the backbone of all their similarities. When stronglybelieved in by a group of people, supremacy can have incrediblydangerous results for those outside of their ideal. The Sons of Jacob’sbelief in male supremacy in The Handmaid’s Tale is devastating to allwomen, just as today’s white supremacists’ beliefs have also beendevastating. White supremacy has taken lives, and the attack on theCapitol is only one example of the danger it brings. Both events, thefictional and the real, show that no matter how beneficial something isfor the ideology of one group, it is always detrimental to others thatdon’t hold the same belief. Thus, the Capitol attack and the fictionalreign of the Sons of Jacob are reason enough to be apprehensive of allsupremacists, no matter what they stand for. Image source "

    "title": "Snowflakes and People: How Differences Make Us Special",
    "body": "2021/01/28 - Have you looked outside lately? With the new year now upon us, we arebeginning to see the classic staple of living in this northern country:snow. White, soft, beautiful, all-encompassing snow. We watch, as eachflake hits the ground, bringing us deeper into the winter season. But ifyou have ever paid close attention to the individual snowflakes as theyfall, you’ve observed that each snowflake is different. Like snowflakes,people are unique, each having differences that deserve to becelebrated. To understand why differences are in our nature, we can lookat how snowflakes come to be different. Get ready for a small science lesson! Snowflakes are different due tothe fact that they each consist of countless water molecules. TheWashington Post states that, by one estimate, a snowflake may have up toa quintillion molecules! The process starts on the Earth’s surface, aswater evaporates from large water bodies. In the wintertime, the coldair causes the water vapour to form into small liquid droplets, whichcondense onto nearby matter like pollen, forming tiny ice crystals. Thecrystals float through the air, and collide with water vapour molecules. As they collide, the water vapour goes directly from a gas to a solid,turning a previously miniscule ice crystal into a snowflake that willfall to the ground. When these flakes first come together, they interestingly look quitesimilar; they all have a hexagonal lattice shape, due to the wayhydrogen and oxygen bond to make water. Certain edges of the snowflakesare rough and jagged; these are the parts that attract more watermolecules in hopes of becoming more uniform. The jagged arms have littleamounts of water molecules added to them, causing them to grow intointricate snowflakes. Each snowflake keeps developing, for about 45minutes to an hour, gathering more crystals on top of one another toform visible patterns. This causes the possibilities of a snowflake’sstructural arrangement to be just about endless. This process isincredibly interesting, because if snowflakes simply stopped developingright after their formation, they would all be pretty much the same. Yet with fluctuating temperatures, weather conditions, and physics,snowflakes take on distinct shapes and sizes. For example, ice crystalswill only form between -2. 8 and 0 degrees Celsius. If this temperatureis lowered, the snowflakes will have thin, needle-like structures, oreven “fern-like arms. ’’ Humidity also affects the appearance of asnowflake, with lower humidity making them wider. Higher humiditydevelops their edges more, and also provides optimal conditions forpacking snow! When thinking about the amazing singularities of snow, I can’t help butthink about how humans differ from one another as well. Each person hastheir own unique thoughts, experiences, and memories. No two people havelived the same life, meaning every single human has differing complexviewpoints on a variety of topics. Just like the crystals on asnowflake, we have undergone our own unique transformations, and ourexperiences shape the people we become. It’s absolutely mind-blowing! This fact is not meant to make you feel trivialized, but to do theopposite. Although we may seem similar on the surface, every person isdistinctive. Each and every one of us provides value to the world aroundthem, just as each snowflake falls to form a beautiful winterwonderland. So, the next time you look outside and see snowflakes descending one byone, be reminded of each one’s singularity. Marvel at the beauty ofnature, and its ability to create billions of entities, each beingexceptional and irreplicable.

    "title": "The Good Place: The Kind of Show We Need Right Now",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - The Good Place is a Netflix series that ran from 2018 to 2020. Itspanned four seasons, and was far from your typical sitcom. Meet EleanorShellstrop, a self-centred, terrible human being who is accidentallysent to  The Good Place , or Heaven, and must therefore improveherself in order to stay there. Over the course of the series, shelearns ethics from a philosophy professor named Chidi, befriends wealthysocialite named Tahani, meets a member of the all-powerful race ofJanets, and a number of other crazy characters. What makes The Good Place different from almost all the other showstoday is its rejection of the sitcom status quo. While it does focus onthe wacky hijinks of the main characters, it is unique because it putscharacter development at its forefront, and constantly rewrites itspremise. The show doesn’t truly come into its own until the end of season 1 -which, without spoiling anything, completely changes what you thoughtyou knew about the characters. From there it takes off, leaning into theabsurdity of its premise (featuring a struggling demon actress as one ofits highlights). This sitcom is one of the few shows that has managed tokeep me consistently guessing and entertained, without losing sight ofits original premise. For a show about philosophy, The Good Place deals with a number ofmoral and ethical dilemmas. Should good deeds count if they are forselfish reasons? What do we owe each other? I had never heard ofutilitarianism or moral particularism before, but the show manages tomake the learning of philosophy integral to the plot - without boringits audience. It helps that Jason, the walking embodiment of everyFlorida man stereotype, is always there with a story about his dancecrew, or a crazy crime he committed - or sometimes even both, as was thecase when he framed a girl named Sheila for stealing boogie boards tostop the best pop-and-locker on his dance crew from moving away. The key reason that The Good Place has appealed to so many peopleduring these times is because it offers a positive view on humanity. Ourinnovation, resilience, and desire to improve ourselves are at thecenter of the show, as Eleanor (and the others around her) become betterpeople. There are more than a few offhand remarks and jabs at oursociety today - particularly with Brent in season 4, who - as theepitome of the  dudebro  stereotype - is clearly based on SupremeCourt Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and manages to come across worse thansome of the demons on the show. However, at the end of the day, the message of the show is a positiveone, as each of the characters overcomes their flaws and become the bestversion of themselves. While the show condemns the humans for their pastactions, it praises them for their ability to improve themselves,showing the positive effect they can have on the world around them. In atime when so many people have resorted to negativity and pessimism, itis the little bit of positivity you didn’t know that you were missing. Over the course of the four seasons, there is one line that I thinkstands out above all others and nicely represents the main theme of theshow: “What matters isn’t if people are good or bad; what matters is ifthey’re trying to be better today than they were yesterday. ” We shouldall aim to be the best versions of ourselves, even when it’s hard andthere is no obvious reward. The Good Place has done exemplary work inshowing humanity at its highest and lowest. It manages to be optimisticabout our future, even when it feels like there isn’t much to beoptimistic about. This is why The Good Place is the kind of show weneed right now. Photo Source: Better Days Ahead by Ian Taylor, from Unsplash. "

    "title": "America as a Global Leader",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - Additional Contributors from the MMUN Team: Diana Brebeanu, MarkoVehauc, and Rohan Kumar. In 1948, U. S. President Dwight Eisenhower was quoted saying, “[T]hereason we call it ‘free world’ is because each nation in it wants toremain independent under its own government and not under somedictatorial form of government. ” (D. Tierney, 2017) Yet to consider theUnited States the leader of this ‘free’ world would be a contradictionof the term itself. Time and time again, America has demonstrated a lackof respect for both the sovereignty of other nations and towards its owndemocracy, while often neglecting to lead in necessary situations. Thus,one is led to wonder if America can really be considered the leader ofthe free world. One of the better-known examples of American interference in foreignsovereignty began in November 1970, when Salvador Allende wasinaugurated as the President of Chile. The great significance of thisevent: Allende was decidedly socialist. Early in his presidency, he tooksteps to nationalize the country’s copper industry and redistributeincome downwards. Despite being elected to a fixed term and thereforehaving his own country’s consent to govern, Allende lacked theapparently crucial consent of the CIA. Thus, he died of a gunshot duringan American-backed coup in 1973. Allende’s role as a democraticallyelected socialist in a country located in America’s backyard was fragileto begin with. The American ambassador to Santiago celebrated this eventby telling Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, that “we shalldo all within our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to utmostdeprivation and poverty. ” (H. O’Shaughnessy, 2013) The United States succeeded in doing this for 15 years after Allende’sdeath. Summary executions, “unexplainable” disappearances, and politicalsuppression were all fixtures of Chilean president Augusto Pinochet’sviolent regime, which received both military and financial support fromthe American government. The hope that Chile was an isolated incident ofAmerican misjudgement would be misplaced. In Iran, Guatemala, Zaire, andBrazil, the United States has provided both military and monetary aidtowards removing democratically elected leaders in favour of brutalmilitary juntas or outright dictatorships. Naturally, this raises the question: What sort of country wouldoverthrow a democratically elected leader and replace them with a brutaldespot? Most observers would agree that any action of this sort wouldexempt any country from bearing the moniker “leader of the free world. ” It seems that, in addition to placing themselves where they shouldn’tbe, the United States, especially under Trump, has found ways to removethemselves precisely from where they should be. From the time of hiselection in 2016, Donald Trump made a concerted effort to do what canonly be described as worsen climate change. His rollbacks of 104environmental policies, though reversible, have unarguably causedmassive damage to the global climate. This damage cannot be undone. Perhaps the most telling evaluation of American damage to climate underTrump comes from Michael Gerrard of Columbia Law School. “Donald Trumphas been to climate regulation as General Sherman was to Atlanta. ”General William Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground. On the globalscale, Trump also removed the United States from the Paris ClimateAccord, at a time when their rivals and allies alike pledged to meetambitious emissions goals. This trend shows no signs of declining. Regardless of Joe Biden’s climate change policies, it’s unlikely thatany Republican president would preserve or build on such policies, asseen in George Bush’s prompt exit from the Kyoto Protocol following hiselection. In a country where the Republican Party is very much alive andthriving, there is little to no guarantee of significant climate actionfor any substantial amount of time. This outright disregard for the world and humanity as a whole should, byany standard, prevent the United States from being regarded as the“leader of the free world. ” However, perhaps more than anything, thegreatest barrier between America and this title is that it can hardly beconsidered a free country. On the surface, the idea of free elections doesn’t seem complex:citizens voicing their political opinions via the ballot. Yet it seemsthe United States has a problem with this, given their recentlyincreased usage of a wide arsenal of voter suppression techniques. One of the largest examples of this is felon disenfranchisement. Moststates prevent felons from voting even after they are out of prison fora time, and some states prevent convicted felons from voting for life. Estimates place the number of Americans deprived of the right to vote bythis at 4. 7 million, 77% of whom are no longer in prison (A. Rao, 2019). One could also reasonably state that this is a racist policy, withAfrican American voters four times more likely to be barred from votingthan other Americans. This and other practices, such as voter purging and gerrymandering,contribute to the finding that, compared with other liberal democracies,the United States is ranked second-to-last on an electoral integrityindex maintained by Harvard University and the University of Sydney. The most important fact is that this pattern does not stop with theUnited States. Many different forms of hypocritical self-marketing innature is present all throughout the world, whether it be thepropagation of a country’s unprecedented prosperity or a company’slaudable ethics. The societal complacency that follows diminishes ourability to hold these enterprises accountable and consequently haltsadvancement. Therefore, it is by developing a deep awareness of thesesocietal flaws and thinking for oneself, that true evolution and ethicalleadership can take shape. Perhaps with these characteristics in mind, acountry that is a true global leader will one day emerge. Photo by Joshua Hoehne, from Unsplash. "

    "title": "Sonder: Why It Is More Meaningful Than Ever",
    "body": "2020/12/17 - Do you know what “sonder” means? Don’t worry if you don’t; it’s a wordthat’s not even in the dictionary. It was first coined in 2012 by authorJohn Koenig, whose project The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows aims tocome up with new words for emotions that currently lack words. Sonder isdefined in Koenig’s book as, “the realization that each random passerbyis living a life just as vivid and complex as your own - populated withtheir own ambitions, friends, routines, losses, worries and craziness. ” I’m grateful for this term, because sonder is a feeling I know but havenever been able to name, until now. It’s especially reminiscent oflooking out over the city from the top of a Toronto skyscraper, seeingcars below me like ants on a sidewalk, people walking around the size ofpinpricks. Looking down on so much life makes you think about the namesand experiences behind all those faces. As human beings, we all gothrough many challenges. But do we ever extend this knowledge outwards,thinking that because we experience so much, so does everyone else?It’s a hard concept to grasp. To consider the fact that all we are andeverything we think is reconfigured in every single little pinprick of aperson, only differentiated by their experiences and past, isoverwhelming. It’s a realization that - no matter how much you thinkabout it - is not possible to fully comprehend. This is no fault of ourown; it just means that we cannot fully understand the value and depthof others’ lives unless we experience every detail ourselves, and thisis impossible. This brings me to a story that is popular at this time of year: AChristmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. This famous Christmas story is ofScrooge, a cold and unsympathetic man who is visited by the ghosts ofChristmas Past, Present, and Future. These spirits take him through hisown timeline to remind him that what you do can have a colossal impacton the lives of others. This realization drives Scrooge to understandthe meaning behind others’ lives, and that people can be going throughincredibly difficult situations without ever making it apparent. He thusbecomes a better person, with stronger senses of generosity andkindness. This story relates to the term ‘sonder’ because it teachesthat other people’s lives are much more complex and difficult than weknow, just as the definition of the word states. By learning this,Scrooge is able to change for the better and help people rather thanhinder them. But why is this important for us to realize? Every single day, we impact the lives of others whether we realize it ornot. Impacting someone else’s life can be as simple as giving a homelessperson a dollar, smiling at someone on the street, or telling a lovedone you care about them. It can also include being rude to a bus driverbecause you’re having a bad day, cutting in front of someone in a line,or honking your horn at another car when driving. Good or bad, all thesethings end up making a difference in someone else’s life, no matter howsmall this difference may be. This is the astute declaration that sonderbrings with it, despite being a term for a quiet kind of sorrow; it alsodemands that upon realizing that everyone is living a life as motley asyour own, you must do what you can to ensure you don’t make someone’slife more difficult. This is why the term sonder is especially important today, in thisfascinating and unparalleled year. We all know that 2020 has broughtchallenges that no one could have foreseen, and we’re all strugglingwith the continuation of COVID-19. Yet we must remember that despitewhat we are personally dealing with because of COVID-19, we are notalone in our difficulties. There are people we may meet once, or neverat all, who are in equally or even more difficult situations thanourselves. We must carry this realization with us throughout our lives,because it teaches us true empathy and understanding. It can drive us tobe more compassionate and more aware of what we do each day, even in thesmallest of ways. To understand sonder is also to change yourperspective, and reconsider your life in terms of the fact that you arenot alone in what you deal with, and you never have been. To leave you with imagery that truly captures the sorrow of the term,imagine being on a city street at night, looking up at a tall building. It’s a snowy evening, with people bundled up in coats and scarves,streetlights brightened and buses passing loudly; above you, rising highinto the cold air, an apartment building spotted with brightly litwindows. It is in imagining this situation that you must think of allthe lives bustling around you. The people passing on the street aregoing somewhere, and they too are thinking of how cold they are, butalso about whatever’s troubling them, which could be anything from mathhomework to a dying family member in the hospital. You will never know,but you must realize that this is something you cannot see. The peopleon the bus are heading somewhere; maybe home from work after a long day,maybe to see someone that they miss, maybe to go visit friends; the busdriver, too, is perhaps sick and tired of carting people around all day. Above you, in the lit apartment windows, people are warming up after along day outside, sitting on furniture they may have laboured overputting together, or spent time saving up to buy. Maybe they areexperiencing a pivotal moment in their lives; having a monumental fight,or celebrating a birthday with loved ones. The fact is, you will simplynever know. To them, you are a passerby too; a pinprick on the streetwhen looking out a window, a blur as the bus passes and turns a corner,or a bundled-up somebody on the street that they overlook and never seeagain. To understand sonder is to feel overwhelmed by this realization, to knowthat you can do nothing to slow the flow of complicated existence takingplace all around you. You are but one single person in a world ofbillions. Sonder is a sorrow because it is almost painful to know thatthere is so much life and joy yet so much loss and pain in the world,all of which you will never be aware of. To conclude, I want to leave you with the full definition of sonder; Ionly provided part of it in the beginning of this article to explain theterm’s intensity without simply stating so. As the original definitionfrom John Koenig’s Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows eloquently describes,“Sonder is the realization that each random passerby is living a life asvivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions,friends, routines, losses, worries and craziness—an epic story thatcontinues invisibly around you, with elaborate passageways to thousandsof other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appearonly once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur oftraffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk. ” Image Source: “Minneapolis, United States” by Josh Hild frompexels. com "

    "title": "MCI Pandemic Perspectives",
    "body": "2020/12/07 - We posed a list of relevant questions to MCI students at each gradelevel, once in May, then again in November. These students gave briefresponses, accounting for their unique experiences over the past fewmonths. The goal was to recognize the different perspectives amongpeople, even though they’re all from one community. We wanted to showhow drastically different our lives are now than they were when thepandemic first began. We hope you might be interested to know how othersat MCI were affected, and how it might differ from your experiences. What was your first impression/how did you feel when first hearing about the virus?: Grade 9: My first impression on hearing about the virus was that itwas important, but not as much of a global issue as it turned out to be. It seemed to be somewhere in the middle between a simple flu and a bigvirus; something we needed to take precautions to avoid, but not a majorissue. I never thought that it would reach pandemic level because itwasn’t made to seem that serious. Grade 10: Initially, like most people, I wasn’t too concerned. Ithought because the virus wasn’t in Canada we didn’t have much to worryabout. However, when we started to get cases over here I wasn’tdistressed, but I was apprehensive to be in large groups or near peoplewho seemed to be sick. Grade 11: When I first heard about the virus, I didn’t think it wouldbecome as big of a deal as it did. But as it got worse and worse I wasshocked at how it got out of hand so quickly. I was just praying that itdidn’t hit Canada like it was hitting countries in Europe, like Italyand China. Grade 12: Personally, when I first heard about the virus months ago, Ididn’t think it was too serious. It wasn't something I really worriedabout until it got more severe. Follow Up: How do you currently feel about the pandemic situation?: Grade 9: I am not too bothered by the pandemic situation at themoment. We are still doing school, which I prefer in quads, and themajor difference is that you can not go out and socialize. I miss that,but I am still able to communicate with my friends on video games andsocial media as well as at school. Grade 10: The pandemic has been around for months now and it’s hardnot to be a little tired of our current situation. I am still veryconcerned with COVID and I am diligent in my safety measures, howeverI’m finding it taxing mentally and I’m hopeful we will have this undercontrol soon. Grade 11: It still upsets me quite a bit. But at this point as I’m ingrade 12, all I am really hoping is that I can start university withoutany/a lot of restrictions. I really want to be able to go into schooland have frosh. I’ve gotten used to it as well, and in some waysforgotten what life was like before the virus, which I guess is sad butis also normal. I really loved summer because I was working andconstantly seeing people at work which was nice, and now it’s niceschool is open. I just wish it was more than every other day or less ifyou have a spare. In short, I feel better, but my feelings haven’treally changed. I find it hard to be optimistic on a day to day basis. Grade 12: I think I have grown pretty used to being in a pandemic. Iwish it would end so I could stop doing uni online and not have to hearthe phrase “unprecedented times” ever again. How are you adjusting to life at home?: Grade 9: I actually like working on my schoolwork at home. It isgiving me more independence and time management skills, which I thinkare valuable. Also, I like the fact that I am able to work on my ownagenda; if I finish something in 25 minutes, I am able to move on tosomething else rather than do nothing until the period ends. Thisactually reduces the time I spend on work and I am able to finish quiteearly. I do miss socializing with my friends, but I am still findingways to communicate through social media and video games. It is tough attimes, but not unbearable, and I try to make the most of it. Grade 10: Life at home is positive. It can be challenging, being stuckwith your family for too long can do that sometimes. So far I’m copingwith it fairly well. Grade 11: Originally I had a hard time adjusting to not being able tosee people and especially my friends. But after the first few weeks Isettled into it. It’s weird because the days feel short and I lose trackof time easier but I’ve gotten used to it in a way. I still don’t likeit though to be honest. Grade 12: For the most part, I’m enjoying my time in self-isolation,sleeping in, and watching Netflix has become a regular part of myschedule. I have been able to spend quality time with my family andwhile I miss my friends a lot (shout out to the gang&lt;3), they’re onlyone call away. However, I have to say online school may be the worstthing I have to go through in quarantine :( Follow Up: How is life at home currently?: Grade 9: I enjoy working at home because it allows me to work on myown schedule. I get bored at times at home but I am always able to findthings to do so that is not a major issue. Grade 10: Life at home is good, I’m always finding new things to doand projects to finish. It’s just hard always being in the same place. Ihave gotten pretty sick of my bedroom after all of these weeks. Grade 11: I’ve honestly been really enjoying living at home. Sometimesit gets boring and repetitive, but I enjoy spending time with my family. I’ve noticed that I’ve become more introverted in a lot of ways so I’veadapted to it more. I’m honestly turning into a homebody! Grade 12: Life at home is good! As I hear about the prospect ofanother lockdown, I feel pretty annoyed, but not really at the lockdownitself. Instead, I am annoyed at people who acted like the pandemic wasover back in September and October, and took no time to consider howtheir actions may affect others. I hope this lockdown will be short andis effective in reminding people they have to be responsible. Give three words to describe the current pandemic situation. : Grade 9: People making adjustments Grade 10: Chaotic, Mysterious, Daunting Grade 11: Futuristic, Chaotic, Mayhem Grade 12: Surreal, Hopeful, Lonely Follow Up: Give three words to describe the pandemic situation. : Grade 9: Work in progress Grade 10: Strenuous, Complicated, Exhausting Grade 11: Hazy chaotic mess Grade 12: Wild, Isolating, Insightful What is one piece of advice you wish you could give to yourself before this all started happening?: Grade 9: I would probably tell myself to do more, and to be moreinvolved with things, because all this time is making me realize that Iam missing doing all of these things, and I could have been doing them. An example would be volunteering. I easily could have volunteered more,and now that I can’t, I am regretting not doing it before. Grade 10: Get bubble tea before it's too late. Also, don’t leave yourmath textbook in your locker over March Break because you can’t get itback now. Grade 11: Don’t stress as much and live in the moment. I know thatsounds cheesy but it’s true. One thing that this has really taught me isthat time is so valuable and unexpected things always get in the way ofyour plans. Grade 12: I want my pre- epidemic grade 12 self to know that theyshould have lived more in the moment when they had the chance, and nothave pushed experiences they really wanted to have to summer 2020because they were too focused on university or job applications. Follow Up: Would you change the piece of advice you gave to yourself back in May, and if so, how?: Grade 9: No I wouldn’t because I think that for the most part I haveused the advice and tried to take advantage of the virtual clubs andopportunities so that I am more involved. Grade 10: Yes I would change that advice. First of all you don’t needbubble tea, and your math textbook will be fine. Pick up a good book anduse this time to do something you love. Don’t just waste these days,they still count. Grade 11: Not really. I agree with what I said. If I had known thingswould change and this virus would last more than 3 weeks, I think Iwould have changed the way I was living-- less worried about whatothers think because that wastes too much time. Grade 12: I don't think I would change my advice, but I would add toit. First, I would want to tell myself that even when I feel alone,there will always be people around me who I can talk to. They wereprobably feeling the same way I was. Second, I would also add somethingabout making a schedule for yourself, otherwise, you willprocrastinate. Finally, I would tell myself to stay positive and focuson myself&lt;3 What is the thing you miss the most about school, activities, and just going out in general?: Grade 9: I really miss just seeing people, and being in a differentsetting. I can still communicate online, but it’s still not the same astalking to your friends in person, or carpooling with friends. That iswhat I am missing most. I am also missing changing my setting. The factthat I can’t go to places and do things makes me realize how much I likegoing to those places and doing those things. Mainly, I am referring tosoccer. I am a soccer player, and I really miss being out there with myteam, practicing, and playing. That will be the first thing I want to doafter the pandemic situation eases. Grade 10: The thing I miss most about going out would probably be thevariety. There was always something different everyday, what I wasdoing, who I saw, whether or not we had strings with Stoica that day. Now I find myself waking up and doing the same thing everyday. It wouldjust be great to see some fresh faces and not resort to watching Gleefor 4 hours straight. I miss the variation the most. Grade 11: My friends! I miss seeing them so much and video calling isdefinitely not the same as seeing them in person. Grade 12: The thing I miss the most about school is everyday humaninteraction, which I often took for granted. I wish I made the most ofall the clubs and activities in that final week of school because Ididn’t know they were going to be my last. Despite my final year beingcut short, the experiences I had and people I met at MCI have had a hugeimpact on me and I will really miss being part of it. Follow Up: What’s one thing you currently miss about “normal” life?: Grade 9: The one thing I miss most about is going out and socializingwith people face to face, and also being able to go into restaurants andstores. I also miss being able to go out without a mask. Grade 10: The biggest thing would be seeing my family and friends. FaceTime and Zoom do not do justice to seeing people in real life. Hopefully soon things will turn around and my interaction with them willbe more frequent. Grade 11: I miss seeing my friends, and going to school to see people!Like all the time! It makes me so sad that there are so many people Imay not get to see at all this year :( Grade 12: One thing I miss about normal life which I took for grantedis getting to see my friends face-to-face almost every day. Now it’salways over Zoom, and if I do see them, it’s only every once in a while. "

    "body": "2020/05/15 - If there is one word to describe the world we live in today, it wouldbe, “uncertain. ” Uncertain of what to do, where to go next, and what isgoing to happen in the near future. Everywhere we turn, the words“virus” and “pandemic” flood our ears, making it incredibly challengingto think of anything else. It may be tempting to try to block out theworld altogether to avoid bad news, but one thing to remember is that wemust stay informed during these times. We have to stay on top ofinformation regarding our global situation, for a number of validreasons.   For one, keeping updated is a way to do our part to stop the spread ofthe virus. We all have an important role to play within our communities. We have to look out for ourselves, and those around us. You may hear thephrase, “we’re all in this together” quite often, and wonder what itmeans. Obviously we’re not physically together, and isolation makes itfeel like we’re actually farther apart. And no, it’s not a High SchoolMusical reference. This phrase is meant to convey that everyone iscurrently going through the same situation. It means we all need toremain united against a common threat, and work to keep ourselves andthe community safe. This can be achieved through listening to our publichealth officials, and taking proper precautions, like social distancing. One can only be aware of these precautions by keeping up with the news,and staying informed.   Another reason to stay informed is knowing how to respond to challengesduring this time. Most of the world, let alone all MCI students, havenever been part of any pandemic situation before. No one knows how toact or where to begin trying to cope with all the changes. These changescause many to feel scared, helpless and not in control. By stayinginformed on new developments of the virus, as well as the necessaryprecautions to take, you are educating yourself on how to combat our newreality. This education becomes a way to feel in control, and stay ontop of the fear. A study conducted by the International Journal ofEnvironmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) found that those whohad reliable and updated information regarding the coronavirus felt moreprepared to handle it. Also, people who received accurate informationabout the virus had lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression. Sowhen staying updated on information concerning the virus, not only areyou learning about ways to react, but you are possibly improving thestatus of your mental health. By learning more about what threatens us,we can combat fear, and remain feeling in control.   Another major reason to remain informed is to stay connected with theoutside world. Through television, newspapers, and the internet, we areable to momentarily escape our self-isolation and see what is happeningthroughout the globe. For example, by watching the news, not only areyou getting information, you are seeing the contrasting effects of thevirus around the world. You get to see what other people are doing, andhow other countries are reacting. Most importantly, you get to bereminded that you are not alone, since the whole world is going throughthe same thing. Getting information and updates is your ticket toexperiencing the world once again, because it allows you to see whatothers are doing.   Finally, although our world may seem scary and uncertain, it is also onethat will go down in the history books. People will remember these pastfew months as the worst crisis since WWII, meaning we are all makinghistory. I’d like to believe our children or even grandchildren may askabout this time; how it felt to live in self-isolation, be off fromschool, and watch everything around us shut down. In order to speak toour experiences, we should be aware of what’s happening throughout theworld. Even though this crisis is terrible, we should be immersingourselves in the current information and updates, so we remember whenit’s over. Those who weren’t present during this time will want to knoweverything, and I, for one, want to be able to share it. So, think aboutit like this: staying informed is a way to truly be a part of thisevent, and if we don’t know what’s going on around us, we may be lettinga historic occurrence pass us by.   To conclude, it is really important to remain informed and updated aboutthe virus, as well as other current events around the world. Now, thisdoesn’t mean glueing yourself to the TV or reading every newspaperarticle. You can be informed by just watching the news once a day, for abrief period of time. Alternately, you can go online to the Globe andMail, the New York Times, the Washington Post, or countless othernewspaper sources, and read a couple articles. By taking ten minutes outof each day, you can learn so much about what is happening around you. Being informed is all about feeling confident and resilient enough to goabout your daily life, without feeling worried. We must remember thateven in a world of uncertainty, there are ways to fight back, and remainin control.   Sources: https://cmha. bc. ca/covid-19-stay-informed/   https://www. mdpi. com/1660-4601/17/5/1729 Image Source: “The New York Times Newspaper” by cottonbro from Pexels "

    "body": "2020/05/15 - Imagine you get a job in your dream field of work. You start off well,yet after a while, you realize that your role in the company is notadvancing and your work is being limited. This is how women injournalism feel on a daily basis. Despite the major strides maderegarding gender equality, the world of journalism is still veryimbalanced when it comes to the representation of males versus females. In recent years, studies and data have shown that there are more femalesmaking up journalism students in universities and colleges. Yet, femalesonly make up 39% of newsrooms. Therefore, the news is predominantlycovered by men.   A lot of this imbalance in representation comes from past and currentgender stereotypes. In 2016, it was reported that in the United States,fields of reporting with over 50% of female representation includedlifestyle, education, and healthcare. Whereas, there was less that 30%of female representation in topics such as sports, weather, and crimeand justice. In Canadian newsrooms, many major news organizations havealso shown large gender gaps, according to a 2015 study. The GlobalMedia Monitoring Project looked into 23 Canadian news organizations,including CBC, CTV, the Toronto Star, and the Globe and Mail. They found that only 43% of reporters were female, and that only 31% ofwomen reporters had covered stories regarding politics and government. Additionally, the study found that women were more likely than men toinclude female sources in their articles.   You must be wondering: Why is equal representation in the newsimportant? One major reason that gender equality in the media matters isbecause women bring new and different perspectives to journalism,sparking more interest in global news and creating a broader audience. The Women’s Media Center put out a study in 2017, outlining theconsequences of a lack of female representation in journalism. The studystated that in 12 top U. S. news outlets, campus sexual assault storieswere mainly written by men. In these stories, male journalists were morelikely to focus on the impact on the perpetrator, and his behavioursurrounding rape charges. On the other hand, female journalists whocovered sexual assault were more likely to focus on the victim’sbehaviour, and how rape impacted them. This is just one examplerevealing a difference in perspective that occurs when the same type ofstory is covered by a man or a woman. Women also emphasize differentideas than men. A study in 2013 found that women writing editorialpieces prominently used words including abuse, assault, children,equality, education, discrimination, and violence. This difference insubject matter and perspective is important to have in the media,especially in news and broadcasting. It provides a more detailed andcomprehensive story, helping the audience to become better-informed.   Now, there is one major question left: Is it possible to have equalrepresentation in newsrooms, and how can we achieve it? Firstly, it isTOTALLY possible to represent males and females equally in journalism!The world of reporting, broadcasting, and news would be far better ifthere were many contrasting perspectives on world issues. Journalismcould be elevated from what it is now, to keep national and globalaudiences engaged and well-informed. To achieve this proper balance, wecan be aware of the challenges that women in journalism face, and standup for their right to equal representation and opportunities. We can useour voices, as well as social media platforms to advocate for thiscause, and inform those around us about the issue.   Image Source: “Woman Writing in Notebook” by Ivan Samkov from Pexels "

    "body": "2020/05/01 - The latest conflict between the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and theirsupporters, and those supporting the Coastal GasLink Pipeline hasrevealed that Canada remains set in its role as a colonizer. Before thebeginning of this year, it may have been easy to deny that Canadaremains a colonizing power, but no longer can that appeal to ignorancebe made.   For those unfamiliar with the situation, here are the main events. Atthe beginning of this year, following a Dec. 31st injunction from theB. C. Supreme Court, militarized RCMP officers raided a camp of FirstNations land defenders, arresting people on their sovereign territory. In reaction, protesters led demonstrations and blocked railways acrossthe country.   The actions of these protesters and the original Wet'suwet'en landdefenders have been highly criticized across Canada in ways that aremisguided and problematic. The record must be set straight. An RCMP raid on Wet’suwet’en land amounts to an invasion of a foreignnation. According to the Canadian law and the United Nations Declarationon the Rights of Indigenous People, these land defenders have the rightto self-governance and territorial sovereignty.   This is an act of colonial exploitation. Canada is a colonial power. Canada was created to extract natural resources. To do this, theCanadian Government along with private corporations killed, ethnicallycleansed, and commited cultural genocide against First Nations people. We saw this in Residential Schools, in the Sixties Scoop and we continueto see it today. This was done to free up land for both resourceextraction and settlers to do the work. It is inherently racist andmorally abhorrent in every way.   A common misconception is that the pipeline is legitimate and acceptedbecause the elected band council system has okayed it. It must berecognized though, that the elected band council is a system put intoplace by the Indian Act to make band councils more similar to othercolonial governments. According to the traditional Wet'suwet'en systemof government, the Hereditary Chiefs are the true and legitimateleaders. This has been upheld by the Supreme Court. Finally, putting all this aside, there should be no pipelines. At all. Anywhere. We are in a climate emergency. Arguments are made about theeconomy and the need to slowly ease off fossil fuels. Unfortunately, thetime for that is long gone. Science says we need to stop producing oiland natural gas now. Many Canadians are unaware of these issues, but it has becomeincreasingly important in political discourse in recent years. Recentmovement towards “Reconciliation” would have the average citizen believethat Canada and its government have ceased colonial actions and areworking to right the wrongs done over the past 400 years. This mostrecent conflict clearly shows that the government cares not forIndigenous Peoples’ rights when there is money to be made. Reconciliation is a farce while colonization continues. Knowing this,when you stand for O Canada, ask yourself: Do you stand for colonialism?Do you stand for cultural genocide? Do you stand for ignoring humanrights? If not, consider staying seated.   *Opinion Piece * Image source: “Wet'suwet'en Solidarity Event - Rail Yard near PioneerVillage Station Blockaded - Vaughan, Toronto, Ontario - February 15,2020. ” By Jason Hargrove fromFlickr "

    "body": "2020/04/30 - Recently, I picked up the book Mindset by Carol Dweck and becameobsessed. While I run the risk of being melodramatic, I must say thatthis book has offered me a new perspective on life and a solution to aproblem that I once thought unsolvable. Now, before I go into anyfurther details, I want to ask you, the reader, a question. Do you thinkthat intelligence is something you are born with or something you candevelop?  Before reading this book I always believed that intelligence, amongother attributes, was a fixed value that couldn’t be altered. I believedthat while hard work could allow you to accomplish more, it wouldn’tchange your inherent aptitude for something. For example, when I woulddo poorly on a math or science test (and trust me this happened far toooften), I would tell myself that “science just wasn’t my thing. ” Theproblem with this mentality is that it didn't allow room for growth. Inmy head, it felt irrational and too challenging to constantly put moreeffort into science. Sure, I could study a week in advance for everyscience test, but what was the point? I didn’t want to keep putting myblood, sweat and tears into science just to stay on par with the rest ofmy marks, or peers (who I believed had natural aptitudes for science). What I didn’t understand though, is that nobody can sustainably excel atsomething without putting work in. Intelligence and skills can becultivated in almost every facet of your life. Personality,intelligence, athletic ability, social skills etc. can all be developed,over time, through hard work, good strategies and input from others.  By viewing our attributes, and others', as fixed values, we are forcedto place our self-esteem on our natural abilities alone. So, when facedwith failure, we are devastated as we believe that we will neverovercome them fully. Conversely, with a growth mindset, you spend lesstime worrying about how talented or  good  at something you are andfocus instead on learning and growing your abilities. Often, when facedwith criticism or failure, we retract into feelings of insecurity anddefensiveness, which directly inhibits our growth and opportunity tolearn from our mistakes. People are born with an inherent love forlearning, but a fixed mindset, derived from society's institutionalizedhabit of praising natural ability, ruins this. We live in a world wherewe believe people are either innately superior or inferior and,therefore, we stick to easy tasks that we excel in, to repeatedly affirmour feelings of superiority, while simultaneously avoiding things thatexpose our inferiority. We sweep under the rug, the parts of our lifethat need the most nurturing and attention, leaving them more neglectedand weak than ever before. With this behaviour, we slam the door on anychance of genuine improvement and growth by letting our conquerableweaknesses constantly hold us back from our true potential. For this new year, I urge you to reignite your passion for learning byletting go of your fear of failure through the belief that skills andability can be grown and cultivated. Unfortunately, I can't get intoall the nitty-gritty details about what a growth mindset is and how toachieve it (it’ll take up the entire Beacon), so I strongly urge you toread Dr. Dweck's book. It’s important to note though that real change and improvement will takecommitment and patience. You can’t expect to immediately flourish atsomething you are weak in, just by suddenly putting more effort in. Itwill take dedication and time to hone your skills and help them developto the standard at which you want them. The main idea is to not getdiscouraged. When I first took on this mindset, believe it or not, Iperformed worse than I usually do. But instead of giving up, I pressedon and used my low marks to determine my mistakes and how to betterprepare in the future. If you are reading this and somehow haven’t gotten bored from myrambling, I sincerely hope that you are motivated and interested intaking up this new attitude and perspective on life. Our world needsmore growth-minded people than ever before, as we live in a world withinfinite possibilities and challenges that can only be overcome by thosemost willing to try. As I wrap this up, I'll leave you with one lastpiece of advice: NEVER - especially in the face of adversity - fixate onyour present ability, but instead on your potential, what is possibleand what you can become.

    "body": "2020/04/30 - COVID-19 is spreading quickly - so quickly, in fact, that by the timethis article is released, these statistics will already be out ofdate*. When news of the virus reached the international community, themajority of the coverage was focused on China, particularly on themillions under quarantine in the province of Hubei. However, by the endof February, there was news of outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, andIran. By mid-March, the majority of the world was under quarantine asoutbreaks spread across the world.   COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world, with over onemillion cases and 56,000 confirmed deaths. Canada currently has 12,000confirmed cases and over 170 deaths. The United States, however, hasquickly become an epicenter for the virus, with over 265,000 cases and6,700 deaths. An online polling survey by Leger suggests that Americansaren't taking isolation as seriously as Canadians - only 86% of USrespondents were adhering to the required 2 metre distance rules, incomparison to 95% of Canadians. Although this number might seem small,it could be a significant factor in determining the death tolls in bothcountries.   Disinformation is still prominent in the battle against COVID-19, andundermines public attempts to fight it. From online posts claiming thatlemons ward off the virus, to Fox News anchors saying that holding yourbreath for more than ten seconds will prevent it, disinformation iswidespread. Worse still, people’s attempts to try to make a profit offof selling their own home remedies do more than damage their personalcredibility - they can prevent individuals, who have the disease, fromgetting life-saving treatment. While choosing not to spread disinformation might be an easy choice,what the governments of the world are faced with today is far from easy. As the world goes into quarantine in an attempt to contain the spread ofthe virus, economic activity halts. This poses many problems, and it isinevitable that massive job losses follow.   In a one week period thisMarch, the government of Canada received nearly 500,000 applications forunemployment insurance, an amount only matched by an eight monthperiod during the recession in 2009. This presents a moral dilemma - achoice between people’s lives, and their livelihoods.   The governments of the world, as this crisis continues to unfold, willhave to tread carefully. Are they prepared to deal with a potentialdepression, and the mental health issues and business failures thatwould result from it? There are no easy answers, and this is not an easysituation. All we can do is stay safe as best we can, and practisesocial distancing for the good of our country and the world.   * This article was originally released on April 3rd, 2020.

It’s not worth the effort to pullout a book, there’s no access to your favourite TV show, and you wantsomething a bit more rewarding than listening to music. The solutionーpodcasts! Podcasts are one of the most underappreciated forms of mediaout there. They are audio programs that focus on the spoken word, like aradio talk show but better. Podcasts are easily accessible, widelyavailable, and there is a podcast for everyone out there, whether you’relooking for lighthearted comedy, news and politics, or dramaticstorytelling. But where to start? In a day and age where time isliterally money and there are thousands of forms of entertainment allvying for your attention, it can seem overwhelming to decide what tochoose. That’s why I’m here to help! I’ve chosen a couple of my all timefavourite podcasts (and I listen to a lot of podcasts). So, whetheryou’re brand new to the world of podcasts or an experienced veteran,here are some of my suggestions that I hope each of you will at leastgive a try. Enjoy!  The Anthropocene Reviewed by John GreenThe Anthropocene Reviewed is a monthly podcast about all things human. In this podcast, John Green (author of The Fault in Our Stars amongother things) reviews anything and everything on a five star scale. Thetopics range from the QWERTY keyboard to velociraptors to teddy bears toSuper Mario Kart. On the surface it may seem like a shallow, fun-time,but it often delves deep into what connects us all and makes us humanthrough the lens of ridiculous and everyday objects and events. By theend of an episode about hot dog eating contests you may be having anexistential crisis about the worth of your own existence and why we’reall really here. Sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes uplifting, everyepisode is a new and delightful discovery about what it means to behuman. Episodes are about half an hour long and there’s no set order orplot, so you can pick it up anywhere, but you may find yourself bingelistening like I do. It’s one of my all time favourite podcasts becauseI love the juxtaposition of absurd topics and thoughtful discussion. It’ll make you laugh one moment and cry the next, which is why Irecommend The Anthropocene Reviewed.  Myths and Legends by Jason and Carissa WeiserMyths and Legends is a weekly podcast retelling old musty myths in anew, funky way. This podcast aims to tell stories, from (in)famous taleslike Robin Hood and Hansel and Gretel to ones you may have neverheard of but will love, like The Eyrie and Meng Jiangnu and the GreatWall. It also features a “Creature of the Week” segment, discussingfoolish and fantastical creatures from myths all over the world. JasonWeiser recounts these tales in a way that’s entertaining, funny, andkeeps you on the edge of your seat. This podcast is an old favourite ofmine because it’s lighthearted and comforting, like a good chickennoodle soup. Myths and Legends is something that I go back to time andagain because it’s casual enough to listen to while doing chores orother mind numbing tasks, funny and entertaining, but still carry alesson. Episodes are usually half an hour to an hour long; some storiessplit into sagas several episodes long, but most are individualinstallments you can pick and choose from. I’d recommend Myths andLegends to anyone looking for an interesting and educationalstorytelling podcast.  Science Vs by Gimlet MediaScience Vs is a weekly podcast that examines controversial topics in ascience focused way. Narrated by Wendy Zuckerman and produced by GimletMedia, this podcast covers many topics, from police shootings to killerasteroids to the coronavirus to vaping. It’s a great surface levelintroduction to these topics and many more, debating the pros and consand often bringing in experts to talk about them. Science Vs is botheducational and entertaining to listen to, and the topics are often veryrelevant to current events or everyday life. I like the informationalyet conversational tone of the podcast and that it gives a generic ideaof the topic without going too in depth, so it can be informativewithout feeling stuffy and formal. Episodes are about an hour long andstand alone, so you can listen to just what piques your interest withoutbeing dragged down by over a hundred episodes. I’d recommend ScienceVs to anyone interested in learning something new in a fun and engagingway. I encourage you to go explore podcasts on Spotify, Soundcloud, or anyother digital platform. Happy podcasting!  Image sources:“Anthropocene Reviewed” fromjohngreenbooks. com “Science Vs” from gimletmedia. com “Myths and Legends” frommythpodcast. com "

    "body": "2020/04/04 - Hey Bears! Earth Hour 2020 (Saturday March 28th, 2020, at 8:30 pm)is rapidly approaching. You probably already know what Earth Hour is,and you might think that it’s somewhat silly.   Nobody actually believes that a bunch of people turning off somelights for one hour is going to change anything, do they? And our schoolcan’t really participate anyway. The timing doesn’t allow it and if weturn off our lights, the school will be plunged into darkness. Indeed, it is an unfortunate truth that MCI’s notorious lack of windowsand natural lighting makes it difficult for us to celebrate Earth Hour. And yes, we obviously can’t “properly” participate because there’s noschool on the 28th. There won’t ever be school during Earth Hour, sinceit takes place in the evening and on the last Saturday of March. Regardless, MCI and many other schools do their bit on the Fridaybefore. But the question still remains - does Earth Hour make a difference?According to the mission statement of EarthHour. org, (the officialwebsite for… well, Earth Hour), the main purpose of Earth Hour is tomake a symbolic commitment to the betterment of our environment. Theevent is meant to “spark global conversations on protecting nature notonly to combat the climate crisis, but to ensure our own health,happiness, prosperity and even survival. ” The carbon emission reduction of the event is indeed negligible (Gollom,2014), but millions of people across 180 countries participate in EarthHour every year, meaning they have taken the time out of their day toconsider how they as individuals can impact the planet.   Yes, Earth Hour is simplistic. Anyone can do it and the second it’sover, we can continue on with our wasteful, energy-guzzling, consumerlifestyles. But for that brief hour, people are acting in unity for ourenvironment. Any act of positive unity in our increasingly morecomplicated society is a moment to be cherished. So if you can, pleasedo consider participating in Earth Hour 2020 with your families andconserve energy whenever possible to carry on the spirit ofenvironmental stewardship. Energy conservation tips include: turning off lights that are not inuse, unplugging appliances that are not in use (yeah it’s annoying toplug them in again, but come on! That’s a first world problem if I everheard one) and changing to energy efficient lights and appliances (thistip does depend on how cool your parents are, of course). The internetis at your fingertips for more information on how you can make adifference, of course.   Happy Earth Hour, MCI!

    "title": "The Don Cherry Divide",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - The winter holidays are a time to embrace the spirit of togetherness, bemerry, and spend time with family. Unfortunately, something happened inNovember that has quickly become one of the most heated issues in Canada(and could lead to awkward conversations with the extended family aroundthe dinner table). This event was the firing of Don Cherry. You’veprobably heard about this, but in case you haven’t, here is a briefrundown of what happened. On Remembrance Day, the 85-year-old NHLcommentator went after immigrants in Toronto and Mississauga, accusingthem of not wearing poppies and not honouring Canada’s veterans. Undoubtedly the part that drew the most criticism was his use of thewords “you people. ” The statement quickly drew widespread criticism, and Sportsnet fired DonCherry. Don Cherry, throughout his history as a broadcaster, has had ahistory of making very controversial statements. These instances includethe time when he complained about “wom[e]n yapping away” at hockeygames or when he said vulgar things about Liberals at the 2010 inauguralmeeting of Toronto’s new city council, describing the Liberal media as“left-wing pinkos”, and “kooks”. One of the things that may have contributed to Cherry’s firing was hisunwillingness to apologize. In an interview he did with Fox News, hesaid that he might have used different wording if he could have done itover, but came nowhere near giving a formal apology. Not only were Cherry’s comments offensive, but they were inaccurate andcounterproductive. While the sentiment of getting people to appreciateall that our veterans have sacrificed for Canada is good, Cherry failedto take into account that immigrants are also part of the Canadianmilitary. Sergeant Stephen Thomas, 37, is a first-generation Canadianwith parents from Guyana, who served two tours in Afghanistan, and wasshocked by Cherry’s comments. He said: “I don’t think he’s realized howmuch the military has changed over the last decade or two. ” The reason Don Cherry was fired was that his comments, whetherintentional or unintentional (as his supporters claim), hurt people. Hisracist, sexist, and rude comments throughout the years may have been fewand far between, but the fact that he was unwilling to apologize says alot about his character.

    "body": "2020/02/01 - A guide to tree-ting this season right (filled with history,controversies, and more!) It has begun. Everyone has simultaneously agreed, as if some telepathicphenomenon has occurred, and set out to accomplish one thing. 98. 1 CHFIhas Toronto’s Christmas Music Station; stores have transformed to fitconsumer holiday needs; Canada’s Wonderland has created Winterfest; andso on. However, the question comes to mind: are you completely prepared forthe holiday season? If you answered no, read this guide! If you answeredyes, read this guide! ReSPECT; don’t ReGIFT! Regifting- although harmless when done thoughtfully- requires carefulattention and etiquette. There are certain rules one must pay heed towhen committing such an act. Firstly, never regift anything meaningfulor handmade. Doing this will transform you into a Grinch! Secondly,regift outside of your circle of friends. This avoids awkward tensionand does not hurt the original gift-giver. Thirdly, regiftthoughtfully. For example, you would not regift a Crock-Pot to your7-year old brother; you would give it to your mom who is in need of one. “When in doubt, regift to charity. ” This saying avoids many conflictsand is a solution towards a greater good. Simply storing the gift orthrowing it away because you got the Crock-Pot 99 instead of Crock-Pot100, wastes many resources, time, and energy. Bake with a Canine Twist! What’s that I smell in your oven? Dog cookies! They are the motive thisseason. The world wide web consists of numerous recipes that you canfollow to bake such lovely treats. Please note that chocolate is a dogno-no! Controversy: Real or Fake? It has been debated out for an undocumented amount of time: should onebuy real or artificial Christmas trees? Firstly, if you have purchasedan artificial tree, reuse it for a long time to make itenvironmentally-friendly. You would have to use it for more than 20years to make it a more eco-friendly option. Real trees, however, havesurprising benefits to them. Christmas tree farms serve as a habitat forlocal wildlife, giving a home to many species. Around 350 million treesare grown on these farms, with 30 million being harvested. In theindustry continuum, these farms appear on the low end. However, it iscritical to compost or recycle your tree properly. If you’re feelingextra spicy, offer your tree to mulching and chipping programs, whichhelp grow more species for one’s garden. To conclude this controversy,buy a real, locally-grown tree. This also allows you to experience theprocess of picking the right one.

I love my rights and freedoms so I’ll read the Constitution. Salty water’s pretty great so I’m buying saline solution. I’ll expand my vocabulary; learn new words like collocution. I’ll visit Doctors Without Borders, and make my contribution. I won’t leave people out, I’ll never be one to shun. That last line was pretty bad, I could have used “exclusion”.

Gone (too soon) are the orange andbrown leafy streets, the comforting sweater weather, the therapeuticfeeling of ordering a pumpkin spice latte albeit it's horrendous taste.

    "title": "A Year in Review: Ranking My Top 10 Films of 2019",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - Over the past twelve months, we were handed a diverse collection offilms. Be it comedies, thrillers, action movies, or dramas, filmmakersnew and old raised the bar for this medium in 2019. As the year comes toan end, I am taking a look back and ranking my top ten movies of theyear. I chose the films that challenged me as a viewer, made me thinkfor days after I watched it, and most importantly, films that were justreally fun to watch. 10. Climax Dir. Gasper Noé Climax follows a group of aspiringdancers in an abandoned school, as their rehearsal spirals out ofcontrol into madness. This film is a visually stunning, yet disturbingerotic rush from start to finish. 9. Shazam! Dir. David F. Sandberg From DC Comics, Shazam! follows14-year-old Billy Batson as he must learn how to deal with God-likesuperpowers. With family values at the core of this film and a stellarchild cast, Shazam! is the most heartwarming superhero film of the year. 8. Ad Astra Dir. James Gray Brad Pitt soars in this film whichexplores the powerful bond between a father and son. CinematographerHoyte van Hoytema delivers a visual spectacle of outer space. 7. The Peanut Butter Falcon Dir. Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz Ayoung man with down syndrome escapes his nursing facility with dreams ofattending a wrestling school. Shia LaBeouf is mesmerizing in thischarming homage to a Mark Twain classic. 6. Midsommar Dir. Ari Aster Midsommar is a confusing, thoughtprovoking, and ambitious film. Director Ari Aster creates anothermasterfully crafted horror film that almost rivals Aster’s previousclassic, Hereditary. 5. The Lighthouse Dir. Robert Eggers Robert Pattinson and WillemDafoe give strong performances in this wicked tale of two lighthousekeepers on a distant island in New England. Robert Eggers reallysolidifies himself as a strong filmmaker in the horror genre with thisfilm. 4. Rocketman Dir. Dexter Fletcher Taron Egerton gives his bestperformance yet with Rocketman. I think it's going to be a long longtime until another film succeeds in creating a movie musical biopic asintense as Rocketman. 3. Booksmart Dir. Olivia Wilde Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut is acoming-of-age comedy between two best friends and academic‘overachievers’ who realize that they’ve wasted their high school yearsslaving away instead of having fun. Booksmart is a wild and fast-pacedmovie that is clever in its portrayal of teenagers. 2. Joker Dir. Todd Phillips Joker is a heartbreaking and brutaltake on the clown prince of crime’s origin story. Todd Phillips drawsheavy inspiration from films such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedyto construct his tale of a man disregarded by society. Phillips’s Gothamis corrupt and crime ridden, but it’s the realism that helps amplify thefilm’s critique of a society that dismisses its citizens. JoaquinPhoenix gives a disturbing performance as Arthur Fleck that at times maycall on the viewer to sympathize with him but strictly acknowledges hisvile actions. Todd Phillip’s direction and Lawrence Sher’s beautifulcinematography accompanied by HildurGuðnadóttir’shypnotizing score help make Joker standout film from 2019 that must beviewed more than once to fully grasp. 1. Parasite Dir. Bong Joon-ho Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite isundoubtedly 2019’s must see film. Every aspect of this film from itscast to its cinematography is fantastic. Parasite’s depiction ofthemes of class, wealth, and dignity are apparent but not in your face. Joon-ho’s slow yet persistent race to the end will keep you on the edgeof your seat. Parasite follows the extremely poor Kim family as theylaunch an all-out assault on the blatantly wealthy Park family. WhenKim’s son, Ki-Woo, secures a job as a tutor for the daughter of the Parkfamily, he opens the door for the rest of his family to infiltrate thePark’s home. The Kim family makes quick work of ridding the Parkfamily’s employees and securing their jobs through tactical and cunningplans. Each member of the Kim family has a moment to shine. The filmstarts off presenting itself as a satirical comedy but takes a jarringturn into brutality. The film spirals out of control in front of youreyes and you are forced to view every disturbing second of it. Bong’smastery of the camera and formulation of violence is electrifying inParasite. This film is truly an unforgettable piece of cinema will bedeconstructed, examined, and celebrated for years to come.

However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school tooccupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, thereare still so many things to do.  Anything snow-related: Take advantage of the season and get outthere. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowballfight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something moreoutlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favouritethings to do is build a snow fort with my friends.   Indoor activities: However fun it is to play in the snow, it’scold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch upon your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots ofinspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hotchocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that’s the besttime to drink it).  Go to a concert: There are lots of concerts in December, manywith holiday themes. So whether you’d like to go see your favouriteartist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely besomething to peak your interest.  Catch up with old friends: I have many friends from elementaryschool who I haven’t seen in a long time. The break is a great timeto reach out and plan a time to get together. And if you don’t knowwhat to do when you see them, perhaps you should try something fromthis list. Happy holidays!Image source:  MerryChristmas!  by xymox islicensed under CC BY-NC-ND2. 0 ich)* "

News, entertainment, music, etc. - withjust the push of a button it’s all there. However, with this newfoundfreedom comes a price that I’m sure you’re already aware of. What we sayonline is usually different, sometimes to an extreme, than what we sayin real life. Most of the warnings that we hear about online safetyinclude never giving away your personal information, or being mindful ofwhat it is you’re saying. But what we don’t hear about as often is howyour personality itself can change.   Let’s say that you’re on an app that connects you to other people (yourfriends, family, even strangers), and you suddenly see something thatinterests you. Immediately you feel the need to comment something, rightthen. The world must know about what you have to say. So, you type aquick comment. Soon, you get a reply and are suddenly having aconversation on a topic that you, in fact, don’t really know much about. So what do you do? Keep having the conversation? It seems as thoughthere’s no other choice. You can’t just log off and leave peoplehanging. So you keep talking, thinking it doesn’t matter. Who cares ifyou’re wrong? This very well might not be you. But the truth is, some people just feelthe need to talk, so, knowing that they’ll never actually meet theperson they’re talking to and knowing they’re not going to have toactually face the consequences of giving said person misinformation,they just keep going. This is really something you need to be watchfulof. Telling other people something that isn’t true and presenting it asfact can mislead lots of people, and can also harm your reputation. Or maybe, instead of talking off the top of your head, you speak inextremes. You might say that you hate something that you see, but reallyjust mildly dislike it. Or perhaps you see something that makes youchuckle a bit, and then say that it was so funny that you were dying oflaughter.   Exaggerating is an easy thing to do on the internet. You want people tolike what you say, to agree with you. So instead of giving an honestreply, you turn your comment into something it’s not, solely for thesake of making more people agree with you. This isn’t a really terriblething, but try to keep it real. While it’s okay to exaggerate a bit, youmight end up having a real conversation when you dial it down a fewnotches too. The last thing people do online is be completely silent. Now this maynot sound as bad, and it isn’t a big problem, especially compared to theother things I’ve been writing about. But you do have social media tobe, well, social. Don’t be so afraid to say something that it keeps youfrom saying anything entirely. A good thing to keep in mind wheninteracting with others on the internet is to say something positive, asopposed to negative. And if someone says something negative to you, tryto be mature. You don’t have to reply, but if you do, make sure that youaren’t being rude or impolite. The best thing to do is just let it go. You didn’t do anything wrong, the other person did, so don’t let thembother you. All in all, just pay attention to what exactly it is that you’re sayingonline. It’s quite easy to misinterpret what anyone could say when it’swritten down, as you don’t have facial expressions or emphasis to guideyou. So be careful, and try to assume the best. You catch more flieswith honey than vinegar. egar. . egar. "

    "body": "2019/12/06 - A lot happens in a year. Each person undergoes easy and hard times,facing both triumph and defeat. This makes up for the time spentthinking, working, and scrambling to get through it all. By December,many people are exhausted, and wish to start over. Awaiting them is anew year. The prospect of something new makes us feel like there’snothing we can’t do, because anything is possible for the future. Thus,we reflect on our past year, and figure out what to do differently fromnow on. With this come our resolutions. People get excited about thechanges they will make to better themselves and their lives. Many can’twait for New Years, and all the apparent bliss that comes with it. However, after New Years, what happens to these resolutions? According to Forbes, studies have shown that less than 25% ofindividuals stay committed to their New Year's Resolutions after just30 days, and only 8% actually accomplish them. These statisticsgive rise to the question: why don’t people keep their resolutions? People tend to fall back into old habits. After the atmosphere ofoptimism surrounding New Years is gone, people will return to the samelifestyles they led before without a thought. Even if they want to alteran aspect of their life, they will live in the same way, and forgetabout their resolutions. Also, we forget that making changes in life takes effort. A lot ofpeople are not willing to try for the small things they want. Stickingto a resolution is easier said than done, and people feel better notattempting something, than trying and possibly failing. Lastly, there is not much motivation to go through with one’sresolutions. New Years is smack in the middle of winter, which is aseason of comfort. The feelings of laziness and sleepiness we feel makeit difficult to want to do anything. This is especially true if yourresolution includes getting out of the house. It is easy to get temptedby a warm sofa or a new Netflix movie instead of stepping out into thesnow. Image source:  Happy NewYear  bynigelhowe is licensedunder CC BY-NC 2. 0 "

Closeyour eyes and read the following. You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water(an average person drinks this in 2. 5 years).

This exposes theperceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount oftime due to its cheap materials. This short lifespan is largely becauseof brands like Forever21, Zara, and H&amp;M wanting to match the growingdemand for new, trendy clothing, resulting in new clothing designs andstyles being created every few weeks! Instead of two season cycles,there are at least 52 seasons for clothing in the fast fashion industry. Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learnabout what you, the consumer, can do to help.  Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or     even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thriftstores or stores that sustainably produce their items. Thedecreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.     Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that     accept them or your friends/family. Before buying your clothes,make sure you know that you will wear it a significant amount oftimes.       Reach out to these fast fashion brands to express your concerns.

    "body": "2019/11/10 - If you’re a Marvel fan like me, then you’ve probably heard about therecent drama between Sony and Disney regarding Spider-Man. If youhaven’t heard about what is happening, here’s a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland’s Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won’t be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel’s latest movie, “Spider-Man:Far From Home” had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn’t understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made.   Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with“Spider-Man” in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release “Spider-Man 2”, and then “Spider-Man 3” in 2007. The third movie didn’t do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies.   Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released “TheAmazing Spider-Man” starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,”The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony’s expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans.   Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films.  Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‘Universe of MarvelCharacters’. “Venom” made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and “Spider-Man: Far From Home” made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been “just the rebound Sony needed. ”Spider-Man is Sony’s greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future.   *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called “Armistice Day” to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.   Vimy Ridge Considered Canada’s most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering  The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace. Historically there is a National Ceremony on the date each year at theNational War Memorial in Ottawa. It is nationally televised and attendedby the Prime Minister, government officials, veterans organizations’representatives, diplomatic representatives, dignitaries, veterans aswell as the general public. What Can You Do? •Remember those who served and the fallen. Honour their sacrifice. •Have a respectful moment of silence •Wear the Remembrance Day symbol, a poppy, with the correct etiquette,that is: on the left over your heart, from the last Friday in Octoberuntil November 11 Image source:  Remembrance DayPoppy_2=  by Sheba_Also46000 + photos-Videos is licensed under CC BY-SA2. 0 ich)* "

    "body": "2019/11/10 - Let’s face it. Most of us aren’t morning people, and with schoolstarting again a lot of us aren’t used to waking up at the crack ofdawn. Gone are the days when we could sleep until noon and constantlypress “snooze”. However mornings aren’t the worst! In fact, they canactually be quite nice. They’re quiet and peaceful. The air seemsfresher and catching a sunrise is always a welcome sight. You might evenhave a bit of time to be productive! So without further ado, here aresome tips so you can maximize your mornings! Go to sleep earlier! This one is pretty straightforward. You need adequate sleep to maintainyour health and sanity! What if you have an assignment? Try sleepingearlier and then waking up earlier to finish it before school starts. Help your circadian rhythm by sticking to a regular sleep scheduleincluding on weekends! Setting/choosing an alarm Sure, annoying alarms will get you up but it’ll also put you in a badmood to start your morning. It’ll leave you feeling murderous. Talkabout waking up on the wrong side of your bed. . . Wake up earlier than you normally do I find that when my alarm goes off getting up is crucial. Lingeringunder your covers might be tempting but it also makes you feel moresluggish and loses precious time for your body to get used to beingawake before you’re off to class. Force yourself to get out of bed!It’ll depend on each person but 6am-7am is a good time to wake up. Open your curtains! Natural lighting = very good. Crack open your window for fresh air andto hear the birds chirp! Put on some music! Music can set up the atmosphere and instantly improve your mood in themorning! You could play your favorite jam to get you pumped up or a nicesoundtrack for a calming and happy effect. Water is your best friend Your body hasn’t had any water for hours by now! Down a glass of freshH₂O to rehydrate and splash your face with cold water to get refreshed. You can opt for a quick shower too! Breakfast isn’t negotiable If you’re like me you’re probably guilty of skipping this vital part ofyour mornings. A healthy breakfast improves your memory and mood andhelps you stay concentrated. It’s key for productivity. Recently I’veleaned towards a small bowl of cereal or toast, some fruit and a cup ofgreen tea or coffee! Exercise Some people may find a walk or run in the morning really helpsespecially in the morning when the air feels fresher. Or just brave anice cold shower and get a mini heart attack. A warm shower might justmake your drowsier. Plan your day! The key to a good end is a good start! Jot down a to-do list in yourbullet journal, agenda, phone or just think about it on your commute. Alternatively you can have a morning journal to write your thoughts orkeep track of your dreams. BONUS (Apps to try out!) Sleepyti. me: This is a sleep calculator that really works! You’llfeel more refreshed in the day if you don’t wake up in the middle of asleep cycle. Sleepyti. me helps you to wake up at the optimal time sothat you don’t interrupt any cycles!

                <p>MCI’s Relay for Life team made significant progress on Thursday, October
20th this year with the “Messages of Hope” breast cancer awareness
poster-signing in Martingrove’s foyer. October is breast cancer
awareness month, and our Relay for Life club took the initiative to
create an event at lunch where students could sign a large poster and
write positive messages. There were two posters, which will be hung up
at the front and back entrances of the school, for everyone to see.
During this event, gold ribbons with pins were given out to each student
who wrote something on one of these posters so they could represent the
Relay for Life club. MCI’s Relay for Life team had pink markers and
chalk for students to use to sign the posters, since pink is the colour
that represents breast cancer awareness. Anyone who walked by the table
was encouraged to write a message, and the posters looked amazing by the
end of lunch. The students and staff members talked about how this event
brought the community together, and students with relatives affected by
cancer spoke about how this event was uplifting for them. Mrudul Anagal,
a relay for life member, said, “This event really brings people together
for a cause that affects so many around the world, and being a part of
Relay for Life is great because it lets you see the school come
together.” Max Hutton, a student who attended the poster-signing, said,
“I find this event really important for those affected by cancer. I have
a family member struggling with leukemia and I’m sure they would be
thrilled to see this event happening.” Relay for Life will also have its
main event in May, so everyone should look forward to raising money for
cancer awareness soon.</p>
