    "body": "2020/04/04 - Hey Bears! Earth Hour 2020 (Saturday March 28th, 2020, at 8:30 pm)is rapidly approaching. You probably already know what Earth Hour is,and you might think that it’s somewhat silly.   Nobody actually believes that a bunch of people turning off somelights for one hour is going to change anything, do they? And our schoolcan’t really participate anyway. The timing doesn’t allow it and if weturn off our lights, the school will be plunged into darkness. Indeed, it is an unfortunate truth that MCI’s notorious lack of windowsand natural lighting makes it difficult for us to celebrate Earth Hour. And yes, we obviously can’t “properly” participate because there’s noschool on the 28th. There won’t ever be school during Earth Hour, sinceit takes place in the evening and on the last Saturday of March. Regardless, MCI and many other schools do their bit on the Fridaybefore. But the question still remains - does Earth Hour make a difference?According to the mission statement of EarthHour. org, (the officialwebsite for… well, Earth Hour), the main purpose of Earth Hour is tomake a symbolic commitment to the betterment of our environment. Theevent is meant to “spark global conversations on protecting nature notonly to combat the climate crisis, but to ensure our own health,happiness, prosperity and even survival. ” The carbon emission reduction of the event is indeed negligible (Gollom,2014), but millions of people across 180 countries participate in EarthHour every year, meaning they have taken the time out of their day toconsider how they as individuals can impact the planet.   Yes, Earth Hour is simplistic. Anyone can do it and the second it’sover, we can continue on with our wasteful, energy-guzzling, consumerlifestyles. But for that brief hour, people are acting in unity for ourenvironment. Any act of positive unity in our increasingly morecomplicated society is a moment to be cherished. So if you can, pleasedo consider participating in Earth Hour 2020 with your families andconserve energy whenever possible to carry on the spirit ofenvironmental stewardship. Energy conservation tips include: turning off lights that are not inuse, unplugging appliances that are not in use (yeah it’s annoying toplug them in again, but come on! That’s a first world problem if I everheard one) and changing to energy efficient lights and appliances (thistip does depend on how cool your parents are, of course). The internetis at your fingertips for more information on how you can make adifference, of course.   Happy Earth Hour, MCI!

You probably already know what Earth Hour is,and you might think that it’s somewhat silly.   Nobody actually believes that a bunch of people turning off somelights for one hour is going to change anything, do they? And our schoolcan’t really participate anyway. The timing doesn’t allow it and if weturn off our lights, the school will be plunged into darkness. Indeed, it is an unfortunate truth that MCI’s notorious lack of windowsand natural lighting makes it difficult for us to celebrate Earth Hour. And yes, we obviously can’t “properly” participate because there’s noschool on the 28th. There won’t ever be school during Earth Hour, sinceit takes place in the evening and on the last Saturday of March. Regardless, MCI and many other schools do their bit on the Fridaybefore. But the question still remains - does Earth Hour make a difference?According to the mission statement of EarthHour. org, (the officialwebsite for… well, Earth Hour), the main purpose of Earth Hour is tomake a symbolic commitment to the betterment of our environment. Theevent is meant to “spark global conversations on protecting nature notonly to combat the climate crisis, but to ensure our own health,happiness, prosperity and even survival. ” The carbon emission reduction of the event is indeed negligible (Gollom,2014), but millions of people across 180 countries participate in EarthHour every year, meaning they have taken the time out of their day toconsider how they as individuals can impact the planet.   Yes, Earth Hour is simplistic. Anyone can do it and the second it’sover, we can continue on with our wasteful, energy-guzzling, consumerlifestyles. But for that brief hour, people are acting in unity for ourenvironment. Any act of positive unity in our increasingly morecomplicated society is a moment to be cherished. So if you can, pleasedo consider participating in Earth Hour 2020 with your families andconserve energy whenever possible to carry on the spirit ofenvironmental stewardship. Energy conservation tips include: turning off lights that are not inuse, unplugging appliances that are not in use (yeah it’s annoying toplug them in again, but come on! That’s a first world problem if I everheard one) and changing to energy efficient lights and appliances (thistip does depend on how cool your parents are, of course). The internetis at your fingertips for more information on how you can make adifference, of course.   Happy Earth Hour, MCI!

    "title": "The Don Cherry Divide",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - The winter holidays are a time to embrace the spirit of togetherness, bemerry, and spend time with family. Unfortunately, something happened inNovember that has quickly become one of the most heated issues in Canada(and could lead to awkward conversations with the extended family aroundthe dinner table). This event was the firing of Don Cherry. You’veprobably heard about this, but in case you haven’t, here is a briefrundown of what happened. On Remembrance Day, the 85-year-old NHLcommentator went after immigrants in Toronto and Mississauga, accusingthem of not wearing poppies and not honouring Canada’s veterans. Undoubtedly the part that drew the most criticism was his use of thewords “you people. ” The statement quickly drew widespread criticism, and Sportsnet fired DonCherry. Don Cherry, throughout his history as a broadcaster, has had ahistory of making very controversial statements. These instances includethe time when he complained about “wom[e]n yapping away” at hockeygames or when he said vulgar things about Liberals at the 2010 inauguralmeeting of Toronto’s new city council, describing the Liberal media as“left-wing pinkos”, and “kooks”. One of the things that may have contributed to Cherry’s firing was hisunwillingness to apologize. In an interview he did with Fox News, hesaid that he might have used different wording if he could have done itover, but came nowhere near giving a formal apology. Not only were Cherry’s comments offensive, but they were inaccurate andcounterproductive. While the sentiment of getting people to appreciateall that our veterans have sacrificed for Canada is good, Cherry failedto take into account that immigrants are also part of the Canadianmilitary. Sergeant Stephen Thomas, 37, is a first-generation Canadianwith parents from Guyana, who served two tours in Afghanistan, and wasshocked by Cherry’s comments. He said: “I don’t think he’s realized howmuch the military has changed over the last decade or two. ” The reason Don Cherry was fired was that his comments, whetherintentional or unintentional (as his supporters claim), hurt people. Hisracist, sexist, and rude comments throughout the years may have been fewand far between, but the fact that he was unwilling to apologize says alot about his character. His firing is a stepping stone in slowlygetting rid of the voices of discrimination better left in the past. Onthis holiday, in the spirit of togetherness, we should all recognizewhat Cherry could not - that no matter what country we were born in, weare all Canadian.

    "body": "2020/02/01 - A guide to tree-ting this season right (filled with history,controversies, and more!) It has begun. Everyone has simultaneously agreed, as if some telepathicphenomenon has occurred, and set out to accomplish one thing. 98. 1 CHFIhas Toronto’s Christmas Music Station; stores have transformed to fitconsumer holiday needs; Canada’s Wonderland has created Winterfest; andso on. However, the question comes to mind: are you completely prepared forthe holiday season? If you answered no, read this guide! If you answeredyes, read this guide! ReSPECT; don’t ReGIFT! Regifting- although harmless when done thoughtfully- requires carefulattention and etiquette. There are certain rules one must pay heed towhen committing such an act. Firstly, never regift anything meaningfulor handmade. Doing this will transform you into a Grinch! Secondly,regift outside of your circle of friends. This avoids awkward tensionand does not hurt the original gift-giver. Thirdly, regiftthoughtfully. For example, you would not regift a Crock-Pot to your7-year old brother; you would give it to your mom who is in need of one. “When in doubt, regift to charity. ” This saying avoids many conflictsand is a solution towards a greater good. Simply storing the gift orthrowing it away because you got the Crock-Pot 99 instead of Crock-Pot100, wastes many resources, time, and energy. Bake with a Canine Twist! What’s that I smell in your oven? Dog cookies! They are the motive thisseason. The world wide web consists of numerous recipes that you canfollow to bake such lovely treats. Please note that chocolate is a dogno-no! Controversy: Real or Fake? It has been debated out for an undocumented amount of time: should onebuy real or artificial Christmas trees? Firstly, if you have purchasedan artificial tree, reuse it for a long time to make itenvironmentally-friendly. You would have to use it for more than 20years to make it a more eco-friendly option. Real trees, however, havesurprising benefits to them. Christmas tree farms serve as a habitat forlocal wildlife, giving a home to many species. Around 350 million treesare grown on these farms, with 30 million being harvested. In theindustry continuum, these farms appear on the low end. However, it iscritical to compost or recycle your tree properly. If you’re feelingextra spicy, offer your tree to mulching and chipping programs, whichhelp grow more species for one’s garden. To conclude this controversy,buy a real, locally-grown tree. This also allows you to experience theprocess of picking the right one.

I’ve got my own problems and I’m looking for solutions, So below are some points for my self-evolution: I'm getting blackout curtains to keep out the light pollution. I’m baby-proofing outlets to prevent electrocution. I’ll use applesauce for eggs and master substitution. I’ll fight my wrongful arrest, escaping persecution. I love my rights and freedoms so I’ll read the Constitution. Salty water’s pretty great so I’m buying saline solution. I’ll expand my vocabulary; learn new words like collocution. I’ll visit Doctors Without Borders, and make my contribution. I won’t leave people out, I’ll never be one to shun. That last line was pretty bad, I could have used “exclusion”.

Gone (too soon) are the orange andbrown leafy streets, the comforting sweater weather, the therapeuticfeeling of ordering a pumpkin spice latte albeit it's horrendous taste. Before those moments, we enjoyed the hot air, the feeling of no school,the beach outings, picnics in the parks, the gorgeous sunsets, thebeautiful long days, and the alluring shorts nights.

    "title": "A Year in Review: Ranking My Top 10 Films of 2019",
    "body": "2020/02/01 - Over the past twelve months, we were handed a diverse collection offilms. Be it comedies, thrillers, action movies, or dramas, filmmakersnew and old raised the bar for this medium in 2019. As the year comes toan end, I am taking a look back and ranking my top ten movies of theyear. I chose the films that challenged me as a viewer, made me thinkfor days after I watched it, and most importantly, films that were justreally fun to watch. 10. Climax Dir. Gasper Noé Climax follows a group of aspiringdancers in an abandoned school, as their rehearsal spirals out ofcontrol into madness. This film is a visually stunning, yet disturbingerotic rush from start to finish. 9. Shazam! Dir. David F. Sandberg From DC Comics, Shazam! follows14-year-old Billy Batson as he must learn how to deal with God-likesuperpowers. With family values at the core of this film and a stellarchild cast, Shazam! is the most heartwarming superhero film of the year. 8. Ad Astra Dir. James Gray Brad Pitt soars in this film whichexplores the powerful bond between a father and son. CinematographerHoyte van Hoytema delivers a visual spectacle of outer space. 7. The Peanut Butter Falcon Dir. Tyler Nilson, Michael Schwartz Ayoung man with down syndrome escapes his nursing facility with dreams ofattending a wrestling school. Shia LaBeouf is mesmerizing in thischarming homage to a Mark Twain classic. 6. Midsommar Dir. Ari Aster Midsommar is a confusing, thoughtprovoking, and ambitious film. Director Ari Aster creates anothermasterfully crafted horror film that almost rivals Aster’s previousclassic, Hereditary. 5. The Lighthouse Dir. Robert Eggers Robert Pattinson and WillemDafoe give strong performances in this wicked tale of two lighthousekeepers on a distant island in New England. Robert Eggers reallysolidifies himself as a strong filmmaker in the horror genre with thisfilm. 4. Rocketman Dir. Dexter Fletcher Taron Egerton gives his bestperformance yet with Rocketman. I think it's going to be a long longtime until another film succeeds in creating a movie musical biopic asintense as Rocketman. 3. Booksmart Dir. Olivia Wilde Olivia Wilde’s directorial debut is acoming-of-age comedy between two best friends and academic‘overachievers’ who realize that they’ve wasted their high school yearsslaving away instead of having fun. Booksmart is a wild and fast-pacedmovie that is clever in its portrayal of teenagers. 2. Joker Dir. Todd Phillips Joker is a heartbreaking and brutaltake on the clown prince of crime’s origin story. Todd Phillips drawsheavy inspiration from films such as Taxi Driver and The King of Comedyto construct his tale of a man disregarded by society. Phillips’s Gothamis corrupt and crime ridden, but it’s the realism that helps amplify thefilm’s critique of a society that dismisses its citizens. JoaquinPhoenix gives a disturbing performance as Arthur Fleck that at times maycall on the viewer to sympathize with him but strictly acknowledges hisvile actions. Todd Phillip’s direction and Lawrence Sher’s beautifulcinematography accompanied by HildurGuðnadóttir’shypnotizing score help make Joker standout film from 2019 that must beviewed more than once to fully grasp. 1. Parasite Dir. Bong Joon-ho Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite isundoubtedly 2019’s must see film. Every aspect of this film from itscast to its cinematography is fantastic. Parasite’s depiction ofthemes of class, wealth, and dignity are apparent but not in your face. Joon-ho’s slow yet persistent race to the end will keep you on the edgeof your seat. Parasite follows the extremely poor Kim family as theylaunch an all-out assault on the blatantly wealthy Park family. WhenKim’s son, Ki-Woo, secures a job as a tutor for the daughter of the Parkfamily, he opens the door for the rest of his family to infiltrate thePark’s home. The Kim family makes quick work of ridding the Parkfamily’s employees and securing their jobs through tactical and cunningplans. Each member of the Kim family has a moment to shine. The filmstarts off presenting itself as a satirical comedy but takes a jarringturn into brutality. The film spirals out of control in front of youreyes and you are forced to view every disturbing second of it. Bong’smastery of the camera and formulation of violence is electrifying inParasite. This film is truly an unforgettable piece of cinema will bedeconstructed, examined, and celebrated for years to come.

However, for some people, the holidays are dull, with no school tooccupy their days, and friends gone on vacations. But fear not, thereare still so many things to do.  Anything snow-related: Take advantage of the season and get outthere. Build a snowman, go sledding or skating, or have a snowballfight. Winter is also the time to ski, or try something moreoutlandish, like ice fishing or snow sculpting. One of my favouritethings to do is build a snow fort with my friends.   Indoor activities: However fun it is to play in the snow, it’scold. But inside, you can make crafts (a great gift idea), catch upon your reading, draw (the snowy landscape will provide lots ofinspiration), or learn to cook something new. Also, drink hotchocolate, especially after playing in the snow (that’s the besttime to drink it).  Go to a concert: There are lots of concerts in December, manywith holiday themes. So whether you’d like to go see your favouriteartist, or maybe go somewhere new, there will definitely besomething to peak your interest.  Catch up with old friends: I have many friends from elementaryschool who I haven’t seen in a long time. The break is a great timeto reach out and plan a time to get together. And if you don’t knowwhat to do when you see them, perhaps you should try something fromthis list. Happy holidays!Image source:  MerryChristmas!  by xymox islicensed under CC BY-NC-ND2. 0  "

News, entertainment, music, etc. - withjust the push of a button it’s all there. However, with this newfoundfreedom comes a price that I’m sure you’re already aware of. What we sayonline is usually different, sometimes to an extreme, than what we sayin real life. Most of the warnings that we hear about online safetyinclude never giving away your personal information, or being mindful ofwhat it is you’re saying. But what we don’t hear about as often is howyour personality itself can change.   Let’s say that you’re on an app that connects you to other people (yourfriends, family, even strangers), and you suddenly see something thatinterests you. Immediately you feel the need to comment something, rightthen. The world must know about what you have to say. So, you type aquick comment. Soon, you get a reply and are suddenly having aconversation on a topic that you, in fact, don’t really know much about. So what do you do? Keep having the conversation? It seems as thoughthere’s no other choice. You can’t just log off and leave peoplehanging. So you keep talking, thinking it doesn’t matter. Who cares ifyou’re wrong? This very well might not be you. But the truth is, some people just feelthe need to talk, so, knowing that they’ll never actually meet theperson they’re talking to and knowing they’re not going to have toactually face the consequences of giving said person misinformation,they just keep going. This is really something you need to be watchfulof. Telling other people something that isn’t true and presenting it asfact can mislead lots of people, and can also harm your reputation. Or maybe, instead of talking off the top of your head, you speak inextremes. You might say that you hate something that you see, but reallyjust mildly dislike it. Or perhaps you see something that makes youchuckle a bit, and then say that it was so funny that you were dying oflaughter.   Exaggerating is an easy thing to do on the internet. You want people tolike what you say, to agree with you. So instead of giving an honestreply, you turn your comment into something it’s not, solely for thesake of making more people agree with you. This isn’t a really terriblething, but try to keep it real. While it’s okay to exaggerate a bit, youmight end up having a real conversation when you dial it down a fewnotches too. The last thing people do online is be completely silent. Now this maynot sound as bad, and it isn’t a big problem, especially compared to theother things I’ve been writing about. But you do have social media tobe, well, social. Don’t be so afraid to say something that it keeps youfrom saying anything entirely. A good thing to keep in mind wheninteracting with others on the internet is to say something positive, asopposed to negative. And if someone says something negative to you, tryto be mature. You don’t have to reply, but if you do, make sure that youaren’t being rude or impolite. The best thing to do is just let it go. You didn’t do anything wrong, the other person did, so don’t let thembother you. All in all, just pay attention to what exactly it is that you’re sayingonline. It’s quite easy to misinterpret what anyone could say when it’swritten down, as you don’t have facial expressions or emphasis to guideyou. So be careful, and try to assume the best. You catch more flieswith honey than vinegar. egar. . egar. "

This makes up for the time spentthinking, working, and scrambling to get through it all. By December,many people are exhausted, and wish to start over. Awaiting them is anew year. The prospect of something new makes us feel like there’snothing we can’t do, because anything is possible for the future. Thus,we reflect on our past year, and figure out what to do differently fromnow on. With this come our resolutions. People get excited about thechanges they will make to better themselves and their lives. Many can’twait for New Years, and all the apparent bliss that comes with it. However, after New Years, what happens to these resolutions? According to Forbes, studies have shown that less than 25% ofindividuals stay committed to their New Year's Resolutions after just30 days, and only 8% actually accomplish them. These statisticsgive rise to the question: why don’t people keep their resolutions? People tend to fall back into old habits. After the atmosphere ofoptimism surrounding New Years is gone, people will return to the samelifestyles they led before without a thought. Even if they want to alteran aspect of their life, they will live in the same way, and forgetabout their resolutions. Also, we forget that making changes in life takes effort. A lot ofpeople are not willing to try for the small things they want. Stickingto a resolution is easier said than done, and people feel better notattempting something, than trying and possibly failing. Lastly, there is not much motivation to go through with one’sresolutions. New Years is smack in the middle of winter, which is aseason of comfort. The feelings of laziness and sleepiness we feel makeit difficult to want to do anything. This is especially true if yourresolution includes getting out of the house. It is easy to get temptedby a warm sofa or a new Netflix movie instead of stepping out into thesnow. Image source:  Happy NewYear  bynigelhowe is licensedunder CC BY-NC 2. 0 "

Closeyour eyes and read the following. You begin as a piece of cheap fabric that required 2700 litres of water(an average person drinks this in 2. 5 years). The workers are tired,struggling with scars on their hands, to piece you together for a livingwage. However, you are only one of many. About 140 billiongarments *are manufactured each year. The amount of resources spent onyou account for nothing as you have a short lifespan. Your impact? Youproduced 1. 2 billion tonnes of CO2 (per year), yet end up in a landfillproducing more methane. * This horrifying perspective effectively portrays the product life cyclethat a fast fashion piece of garment experiences. This exposes theperceived benefit of $20 jeans that last for a very short amount oftime due to its cheap materials. This short lifespan is largely becauseof brands like Forever21, Zara, and H&amp;M wanting to match the growingdemand for new, trendy clothing, resulting in new clothing designs andstyles being created every few weeks! Instead of two season cycles,there are at least 52 seasons for clothing in the fast fashion industry. Now that you have learned about the harms of the fashion industry, learnabout what you, the consumer, can do to help.  Reduce the amount of clothing you buy from fast fashion stores, or     even better, stop shopping there altogether. Shop from thriftstores or stores that sustainably produce their items. Thedecreasing demand is sure to change their manufacturing processes.     Instead of throwing out your clothing, donate it to stores that     accept them or your friends/family. Before buying your clothes,make sure you know that you will wear it a significant amount oftimes.       Reach out to these fast fashion brands to express your concerns.   Spread awareness to people you know to expose the hidden truths     behind these companies.    This November, empower yourself and others to create less carbonemissions. The fast fashion industry is one of the largest contributors,if not the largest, to climate change. Surprisingly, it is not one thatpeople think of.

If youhaven’t heard about what is happening, here’s a summary. Sony has ownedthe film rights to Spider-Man since 1998. In 2015, they made a deal withDisney, agreeing to lend the character of Spider-Man to Marvel Studios,a company owned by Disney, and to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As wehave seen over the last few years, Tom Holland’s Spider Man has played alarge role in many Marvel movies. Recently, Sony and Disney haverevisited their deal, and gone through negotiations about future stepsfor the Spider-Man character. On August 20th, 2019, Sony announced thatKevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, won’t be playing a role in theproduction of the next Spider-Man film. This means that Spider-Man iscurrently not a part of the MCU anymore. This news left fans feelingboth angry and heartbroken, since Marvel’s latest movie, “Spider-Man:Far From Home” had set up Spider-Man to be the new face of thefranchise. Upon hearing about this, I didn’t understand what happenedbetween the two major companies, and wanted to know the reason behindthe decisions being made.   Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and gets to keep them as long as theymake a new Spider-Man movie every five to six years. They started with“Spider-Man” in 2002, starring Tobey Maguire. After its success, theyproceeded to release “Spider-Man 2”, and then “Spider-Man 3” in 2007. The third movie didn’t do quite as well as hoped, costing $260 millionto make, with profits dipping significantly from the first two movies.   Five years later, Sony decided to reboot the series, and released “TheAmazing Spider-Man” starring Andrew Garfield. This movie made over $700million worldwide. With its success,”The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was made. Unfortunately, it did not live up to Sony’s expectations, with the veryhigh production costs and lessened excitement from fans.   Because of their failed attempts, Sony struck a deal with Disney in  Marvel would be able to use Spider-Man in their cinematicuniverse, while Sony kept distribution rights and creative control. Sonyproducer, Amy Pascal, who played a big role in the creation of theSpider-Man movies since 2002, produced  Spider-Man: Homecoming  and Spider-Man: Far From Home  with Kevin Feige. This deal had beenupheld by both sides, until Sony decided to revisit the idea of makingtheir own Spider-Man films.  Recently, Sony has been doing well with their own ‘Universe of MarvelCharacters’. “Venom” made over $800 million worldwide after beingreleased in 2018, and “Spider-Man: Far From Home” made over $1 billionthis summer. These successes have been “just the rebound Sony needed. ”Spider-Man is Sony’s greatest property, and they are highly motivated tokeep it in their control. . This is why they had such an interest intaking back the character. Another reason why the deal was beingrevisited was because Disney wanted a 50/50 stake in future Spider-Man  movies. Sony wanted to keep the deal as is: where Marvelreceives up to 5% of first-dollar gross and all merchandising revenue. As of right now, no new deal has been made. This indicates that unlesssomething changes, Marvel Studios will not be involved in the making ofnew Spider-Man movies, and no MCU characters will be referenced. Sonyhopes that Director John Watts and star Tom Holland will return for twomore Spider-Man films. Even though this feels like a big loss for fans,we should remember that there are still more movies being made, and eventhough Marvel seems to be out of Spider-Man's life right now, Sony ishopeful that a deal could still be made in the future.   *Note: This article was written before the agreement between Sony andDisney to keep Spiderman in the MCU was reached.

    "body": "2019/11/10 - Remembrance Day Remembrance Day (Jour du Souvenir) is observed annually on November11, the anniversary marking the end of World War 1.   The First World War was the largest conflict the world had ever seen atthe time. The war was a result of many factors, including politicaltension and military alliances. The assassination of Archduke FranzFerdinand of Austria in 1914 sparked the beginning of a crisis and thewar began that same year in August. It would become a bloody four yearwar with close to 61,000 Canadians killed. Originally the day was called “Armistice Day” to commemorate thearmistice agreement which ended the war on Monday, November 11, 1918, at11 a. m, the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.   Vimy Ridge Considered Canada’s most celebrated Canadian military victory, thebattle of Vimy Ridge was fought from the 9th to 12th of April 1917 onthe Western Front of northern France. Four divisions of the CanadianCorps fought united and captured the ridge from the German army. It wasthe largest territorial advance of any Allied force at that point in thewar. Unfortunately the cost of the victory was overwhelming; more than10,600 Canadians were killed or wounded in the battle. Today a memorialstands at the top of the ridge to honour the 11,285 Canadians killed inFrance throughout the war who have no marked graves. Remembering  The day serves to remember all the lives that were lost in the line ofduty and the countless sacrifices soldiers made to uphold internationalpeace. Historically there is a National Ceremony on the date each year at theNational War Memorial in Ottawa. It is nationally televised and attendedby the Prime Minister, government officials, veterans organizations’representatives, diplomatic representatives, dignitaries, veterans aswell as the general public. What Can You Do? •Remember those who served and the fallen. Honour their sacrifice. •Have a respectful moment of silence •Wear the Remembrance Day symbol, a poppy, with the correct etiquette,that is: on the left over your heart, from the last Friday in Octoberuntil November 11 Image source:  Remembrance DayPoppy_2=  by Sheba_Also46000 + photos-Videos is licensed under CC BY-SA2. 0 ich)* "
